## Remembrances of a Woman's Life in the Seventeenth Century 

'Alice Thornton's Books' is a collaborative research project 
which will enhance understanding of the lives and works of early modern women.

While by no means the only seventeenth-century woman to write her own life story, 
Thornton is unusual in having written four different versions of her autobiography. 
Collectively, her books offer an extraordinarily rich insight into gentry life 
in seventeenth-century Yorkshire, at a time of civil war, plague, and a high infant 
mortality rate. 

**This website will provide resources aimed at better understanding the life and 
work of Alice Thornton** and, in due course, will host a fully searchable digital 
edition of all four of her autobiographical texts.

After her father's death, she married a member of the lesser gentry in North 
Yorkshire, William Thornton. They had nine children, but only three were still 
alive when William himself died in 1668.

Alice continued to live at East Newton until her own death in 1707. 
In her will she left her daughter Nally 'three Books of... my life', 
together with all other books written in her own hand.
