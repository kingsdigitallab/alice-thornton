          fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
          it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it
          be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  And he said, Come. And
          when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to
          go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
          beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately
          Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O
