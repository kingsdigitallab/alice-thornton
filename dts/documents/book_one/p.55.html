            Thy Commandements.) Now, seeing O Lord, such<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>
                 miserie hath accrued unto us, by the Act of the first<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>

                 the Covenant of thy free grace, which the second. Adam hath<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>

                 suffered for sin, that wee whoe were nothing but Sinn<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>
                 might be made Rich by the imputation of his all sufficient<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>
                 Righteousnes. But deare Father, such are our infirmi-<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb" data-tei-break="no"></br>
                 -ties, that wee have bin so farre from Acknowledging<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>

                 towards us. that was content to suffer death, (even the<br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>
                 scornefull death of the Crosse for our Sakes;) so farr from the <br class="tei-lb" data-tei="lb"></br>
