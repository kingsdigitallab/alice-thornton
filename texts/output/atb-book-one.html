<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The feare of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdome

   Remember now thy Creator, in the daies of thy youth,
   While the Evill daies come not, nor the yeares draw
   nigh, when thou shalt say, I have noe pleasure in them.
   And thou Solomon my Sonne, know thou the God of thy
   Fathers, &amp; serve him with a perfect heart, &amp; with a
   willing minde: for the Lord searcheth all hearts,
   &amp; understandeth all the imaginations of the thou-
   -ghts: if you seeke him, hee will be found of thee, but
   if thou forsake him, hee will cast thee off for ever.
   A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son
   is the heavinesse of his Mother. Pro. 20: 22.
   Children obey your Parents in the Lord for this is right.
   Favour is deceiptfull, &amp; beauty is vaine, but A

A deliverance from a fire in London. 1631.

   There was a great fire in the next House to ours in St

   beeing neare to have burnt it downe, but through
   the caire of our Servants it was prevented. this was don 
   at night when my father &amp; mother was att Court.
   but wee were preserved that time of fright at my Lady
   Levestones house beeing caried by Sara our maide.
   This fire seemed to me as if the day of judgement was
   come causeing much feare &amp; trembling. yet we were
   all delivered from perishing though my father had
   much losse./ But blessed be the Lord my God who gave
   us not over to perish by this fire, but preservd

A deliverance from Ship-Rack in A Passage into
-----------------------------------------------------

Ireland with my Mother, brother, &amp; 2 Nephewes.
Thomas &amp; Christopher Danby. In the yeare: 1639.



<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">having come over into England, when my Mother
   came for her cure of the dissease of the Stone to the Bat-hes
   &amp; Bristoll water, St Vincents well; (uppon which Rose
   hanging over it, is got your Bristow Diamonds.) in
   her returne backe into Ireland, she carried my
   Sister Danbies 2 Elldest sons. for theire better
   Education, When we came to Nesston. at the Sea
   side we staied for a winde a weeke; And in that time
   there was a great Storme on the Sea in soe much as
   there was 5 Ships cast away upon the Shore before
   our Eyes. so nigh were some of them, that, the maine
   mast, did allmost touch the window of that house,
   where we laid. Yet the night proveing calme
   and winde faire We tooke Ship for Ireland in
   one of the Kings Ships new built. Upon the 22th of
   August. 1639. with in one houers Saile. A most 
   Tirrible Storme &amp; tempest arose. Soe fiercely. that 
   we were drove on lee all night &amp; with in lesse then 10
   houers we were 12 miles beyond Dublin. lieing at
   Hull, and Anchor all day. And but for a fisher botte
   sent from Mr Hubert to assist the Kings Ship in distresse
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   16. 
   
   Wee had undoubtedly perished, beeing drove by
   the force of Tempest backe in to the crosse Seas. &amp; 
   10 houers were at Anchor, beaten on the Sandes 
   before that fisher man could come neare to helpe us.
   at the last, about 8 a clocke at night, we got Safe
   To harbour
   
   through the infinitt mercys of our great, &amp; Powerfull
   Lord God, we landed safely at the shore of the Skirries.
   where the same Hubert with all his familie, &amp; freinds
   mett us with great Joy, entertaining my mother &amp;
   All hers, with abundante affection, &amp; kindenesse.
   Which he did uppon the account of obligation, to shew
   his gratitude for an Emminent peice of Justice
   don him from my father. whoe had decided a
   grand controversie in Law suites, which was depending
   20 yeares, almost to his utter Ruine. his adversary
   being so potent. that he could not gett his cause heard
   till that time; when through the uprightnesse of the 
   Judge, &amp; honnesty of the man his cause rightly de-
   termined. &amp; he preserved.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This providence was the more remarkable. that God
   soe ordered our ship to this shore, where my Moth
   found all manner of releife for us all which we wanted
   And on the next day, Came My father from Dublin
   in the company of many noble freinds in Coatches.

   To carrie us home to Dublin where my deare Mother
   was receaved with all Joy &amp; gladnesse. liveing in 
   much peace &amp; happinesse till the death of my Honoured
   Father. 
   When about a yeare affter his death. she 
   was forced to flie into England, uppon the Rebellion
   which brake out in Ireland.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
   
   But I must not forgett a second preservation of
   my owne selfe from drowneing. out of that ship, at
   that time, when a cable from the bote that came to 
   carrie us to land, &amp; beeing tied to our Ship. by it’s
   force, had like to have pulld me out of the Ship in
   to the Sea. Which it had don, but that by Gods providence
   a Shipman comming at that minuite from under the 
   Decke pulled me backe, &amp; saved me from falling
   into that Tempestious Sea, when I was halfe over
   borde. This great &amp; wonderfull mercy, &amp; my Single
   deliverance must not be forgotten but had in a 
   perpetuall remembrance of me forever &amp; therefore

   in much praiers &amp; meditations, both aloud &amp; offten in his

   in his heart, since he was brought into her house; it beeing
   not two yeares, at which time he was a Papist affter his owne
   poore Parentes religieon. but affter he came into my father
   house in Ireland, &amp; brought into England, by my mother.
   he was through all good instructions, &amp; teatchings, as to

   of his Soule, &amp; he became a true convert, &amp; a patterne of
   much goodnesse, &amp; vertue, that I never saw the like in many
   yeares, above his, beeing about 9 yeares old. This poore boy
   alalong his sicknesse, still praied for me when he heard
   I was in danger of death desired with teares that God would be
   pleased to spaire my life &amp; to blesse me that I might live to
   doe much good to others. as to him, &amp; that he might rather

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And it did please our gracious father to releive him
   out of his missery by Death, about 14 daies affter

   could be expected from such a Childe. he freely &amp; will-

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I had great reason to take especiall notice of the great

   bring this poore soule out of the darknesse &amp; ignorance
   of his sinfull education in which he was. &amp; it was the
   good providence of God, so to order it, thus the accident
   
   was. As my father was upon the greene, one day bowling
   seeing a poore naked boy in Rags, yet pritty &amp; nimble
   was very officious in gathering up his bowles. He tooke
   notice of him with intentions of charity towards the boy.</p>

   all his old waies that he was bred up in his Papist freinds.
   he would bring him up in the true feare of God. And
   he would take caire of him &amp; provide for him that he
   should never want all his daies.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At which the boy was very glad, &amp; said he thanked his Lordship

   he tooke him home, clothing &amp; nourishing him till hee died

   he receaved such instruction &amp; as that I hope the Lord had
   glory thereby, &amp; that poore soule now reapes the beneifitt of

   From Weschester my deare mother removed with her 3 yonger
   Children. Alice. Christofer. &amp; John Wandesforde. (She having
   sent her 2 grand sonns home from Chester before the seige)
   with these, &amp; severall servants &amp; tennants, though with much difficulty
   by reason of the interchange of the Kings Armies, &amp; the Parliament
   
   she was brought into the Towne of Warrington, towards coming
   in to Yorkeshire, she finding more favour by reason of the Captains
   Civility. &amp; by a passe from Coll Shittleworth then usuall.</p>

   haveing lost all in Ireland, only 2 Trunks of wearing

   at night, we came weary into the towne of warrington.
   After a while, we were entertained, with Alarums as was
   pretended from the Kings party in Chester. this was
   but to awaken theire diligency the more. but there was
   noe cause; for that poore Towne had worke enough to defend
   it selfe from its Enimies. </p>
 

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">From Warrington, we went to Wiggen the next day,
   beeing a Towne Zealous for theire King, &amp; Church. wee
   found it sorely demolished, &amp; all the windowes broaken
   many, sad complaints, of the poore inhabitants beeing
   at our first comeing was scarred least we should have
   bin of the Parlament party. Theire cries weare the greater in
   respect they weare inforced, to see the burning of 500d
   of theire owne Bibles. publickly at the Crosse by the Soldiers
   which they plundered, under pretence of beeing Popery,
   in theire Service books. and reviling them with the names
   of Papists Dogs. But this Towne had bin preserved
   from such fallse doctrine, or herisie, &amp; would have died
   for the true Proffession of the Prottestant religion. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The memory of Dr Fleetewood was so famous at that

   liveing about 30 yeares since with them &amp; by his life &amp;
   doctrine had sett such good order amongst them that they
   still retained the true Religion he taught. They heearing
   that my mother was his neece, flocked abundantly to see her

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The next day, we passed from thence towards yorkeshire
   with many praiers from this People. And when we came
   to the borders of Lancashire, at a place called downham,
   we were not permitted to passe. but with harsh language, &amp;
   Abuces by a Parliament Corporall, &amp; his gang. they would
   not beleive our passe. but tooke us downe, swearing &amp; 
   threatning, we should be striped. so my deare mother
   &amp; all of us was forced to come into a pittifull house for
   shelter, &amp; lie there all night, with heavy hearts, least we 
   should have bin used barborously, as they contineued in

   blessed be his holy name for ever. &amp; turned shame upon
   those cruell men that did abuse us. That night 2 of them-

   10 miles off. who upon the sight of his owne passe. did de-
   -claire his grand displeasure for theire rudenesses to my
   Mother, &amp; Child: causing his nephew Captaine John Ash-

   his quarters laid, wishing her a good jorney. Thus did

   The occassion of his death &amp; our misery was
   this. // uppon the dispatch of that bussinesse at London by

   My brother George deemed it his part to returne thanks

   That night, came to Hipswell. to consult my mothers 
   advice about writing to London to Mr Rich Darley
   about that bussinesse. Affter his obeisance &amp; craving her
   blessing. tould her he was now goeing to Richmond, to my
   Uncle Will.m where he would write to Mr Darley, desiring to
   know what she pleased to command him further in it:</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">My Mother said that her service &amp; thankes must be returned
   him for all his kindnesse in that bussiness which she would have
   don herselfe by writting. but that she was sudainly surprised
   at that instant of his comeing up to the Chamber, with much
   feares for me, who was, soe violently tormented with a
   
   paine in the right side of my necke amongst the sinneus &amp;
   which caused me to cry out in extreamity, nor could she
   imagine what was the cause, only she still anoynted it with
   oyle of Roses. / My brother seeing me in such paine
   Asked how it came. of which I could give noe other account
   haveing bin as well before as ever, till I was combeing my
   head toward the right hand, &amp; bending my necke as he came
   up the staires, &amp; ever since it had held me greiveously.
   this was the sircumstances of the strainge paine, which held me
   strongly till about halfe an houer. which was the very time
   of his drowning.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">but to proceed to the circumstances of himselfe. he pittied me
   much &amp; would have staied with me, but that his uncle will.m
   staied for him at Richmond for letters that Post. And affter his
   walking, 3 or 4 turnes about the chamber in his studieng
   of his bussinesse, still my thoughts I saw a great deale of 
   change, he looked so seariously &amp; soberly. as if there was
   some great change neare. but what I knew not. only feared
   the worst that we should be deprived of him whom I so dealy
   
   <p> [word] SiC – i.e., dearly.</p>
    loved</p>






105.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He in a very reverent manner kneeled downe and
   asked blessing at his goeing out againe not long before
   which my mother tooke notice of, praieng God Almighty to bless
   him &amp; said sonn I gave you my blessing but even now, how
   cometh it that you take so solomne a leave of me.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">he answered. for sooth I cannot have your prayers &amp; bles
   -sing for me too often. and so with her praiers for him in his
   preservation, &amp; his most humble obeisance in a dutifull
   manner he tooke his leave; biding me faire well deare
   sister. I hope to find you better at my returne home.
   I likewise praied him to have a caire of him selfe. &amp;
   lookeing affter him I thought he had the sweetest aspect
   &amp; countenance, as I ever saw in him, &amp; my ♡ was 
   even full of feares that we should losse him. there was soe
   great and intire an affection for him on whom we did all
   much depend. &amp; speaking of this to him, he said I was
   allwaies full of feares for him but hee did not deserve it
   And this was the last parting we had in this world with a
   bundance of deare love &amp; affection betwixt us as we ever
   had in our lives together.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Going affter this downe staires hee called for his horrse. &amp;
   although he had 2 men my mother kept for him yet tooke
   he neither with him but bid his foot man Iames brodricke
   an (Irish man &amp; an excelent runner) to meete him at
   Richmond. at 11 a clock where he was to mette my uncle will
   soe my brother went towards the River; And as he rid by
   our Chapell where there was a wedding that day. he asked the
   People, whether the Swaile might be riden. they said that 
   there had bin a flood. but it was fallen for some had crost
   the water that morning. soe he biding the People joy in theire

   106. 
   
   Other side he went downe as cairfully &amp; slowly as foot
   could fall. Nor was the second flood come so high till he
   was in the midest of the River, but when it comes from the
   Dales it falles with a mighty mountaineous force sudainly
   
   As I can my seelfe testifie, whoe (through the mercys of God)
   was very nigh perishing in that water, once or twice, but was
   delivered.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">for as I was comeing betwixt St. Nickolas, &amp; our house at
   Hipswell, if I had bin but 2 yerds of the shore, I had bin lost.

   horrse length

   midle girths. albeit, it had bin all the time, I passed through
   before the flood came downe. but a little above the fettlocke.
   Thus wonderously was I preserved from drowning. The
   Lords holy name, be praised even for ever for my eminent
   deliverance from perishing in &amp; by these floods of waters</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But to returne, to the sad relation of my brother, which we was
   informed of, by 2 men which walked beyond the River.
   they perceaving A gentleman goeing downe to the water, 
   imagining it some from Hipswell, seeing afarre of that the
   flood came sudainly, &amp; mightely downe. made haste to

   March the 31, 1651. was his blacke munday. the strange
   paine which seised on my necke portended this Sadd losse.
   Great, &amp; infinitt, was the search by thousands, of People
   from that time till Wednesday following, his bodie not beeing found
   till on that day, &amp; about the time when he was lost.</p>

   the place he was drowned. John Plummer the mans name.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Affter they had drawne him up, caire was taken of his

   on Cattericke brigg, that night because it was deemed the
   bringing him to Hipswell, would, too much have agravated
   my mothers excessive sorrow, &amp; indangered her life allso.
   
   
   He was carried by coach, to Kirklington in the company

The Mariage of Alice Wandesforde Decm. 15. 1651.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After many troubles &amp; afflictions, under which it 
   pleased God to Exercise my mother, &amp; selfe in, since the death
   of my father, she was desirous to see me comfortably 
   settled in the Estate of Marriage. in which she hoped to recea
   -ve some sattisfaction; finding Age. &amp; weaknesse, to seize
   more each yeare. which added a spurre to her desires, for the
   future well being of her Children according to every one
   of theire capacities.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As to my selfe; I was exceedingly sattisfied in that happie
   &amp; free condittion; wherein I injoyed in that time with delight abundantly
   in the service of my god &amp; the obedience I owed to such an exce
   -lent Parent. in whoes Injoyment I accounted my daies
   spent with great content and comfort; the only feares which 
   possessed me, was least I should be deprived of that great
   blessing I had in her life. nor could I with out much reluc-
   -tancy draw my thoughts to the change of my single life,
   knowing to much of the caires of this world sufficiently
   with out the addittion of such, incident to the married. Estate.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">As to the fortune left by my father; it was faire, &amp; more
   then Competent, soe that I needed not feare (by Gods blessing
   to have bin troublesome to my freinds, but to be rather in a 
   condittion to assist them, it need had required.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Especially more, in regard. that I was confident of what
   my deare mother could doe for me (living,) &amp; at her death.
   Soe that to shew my deare affection towards my brother 
   George. in the time of his straights. for his better helpe in
   his Estate; beeing sore burthened with Debts Anuities &amp;c 
   I was willing to transferre, 500l of my English portion
   to be receaved out of Ireland. which would have eased that 
   of Kirklington. / But since his death. when my 2d 
   Brother came heire. there was not that cause to contineue
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   119. 
   
   The same; by reason that both the sequestration was taken
   of, &amp; the wardship mony of his brother denied to be paid to Sir
   Edward Osbornes Excecutor &amp; that he was better by 200l
   a yeare in his Estate, with many other considerable ar
   -guments arriseing towards my mother &amp; my selfe;
   for there was such unhansome dealings to us not to
   say (dishonest), since my brothers marriage. as could neither
   induce her, or my selfe, to part with our Estates with 
   out security.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But I shall be silent in these things, which afforded us
   too much troubles. &amp; sorrowes. wishing rather to cover
   all things of the nature of disputes betwixt such neare
   relations.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And with all my youngest Brother John. beeing fallen into
   a grievous distemper, through griefe, uppon harsh Dealing
   affter the marriage of my brother Christ. who by ill councell
   given him; detained, his right of Anuity of 100l per Annum
   (to his great prejudice) &amp; John was likely theire by to leave
   both that 100l in England. with his whole fortune (then desend
   ed upon John, by his brother George his death) of 6000l out of the
   Irish Estate. to my brother Christopher.//</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Weighing all these reasons, together; &amp; that I had noe
   maintenance from Kirklington as I ought to have
   had, by my fathers will, but was willing to foregoe that to
   my uncle will.m wandesforde towards the payment of Debts
   I had noe reason; from all these considerations to lose
   the payment of the said 500l out of Kirklington.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yet I doe beleive from hence proceeded much displeasure
   that I would not consent to wrong my selfe of the whole.
   in soe much that affter the bussinesse of sequestration was
   cleared he desisted the acting any thing in my behalfe</p>






120.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Neverthelesse, such was my dear mothers affection to the
   Family, for itts preservation; that she harkned to the pro-
   posall made for Mr Thorntons Marriage: Albeit there
   -in she disobleiged some Persons of a very good worth &amp; quality
   which had solicitted her earnestly in my behalfe, &amp; such
   as were of large &amp; considerable Estates. of her neighbours
   about her. And affter the first &amp; second view betwixt us
   she closed soe farre with him that she was willing he should 
   proceed in his suite. &amp; that cordially, if I should see cause, to Accept
   </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For my owne perticuler, I was not hastie to change my 
   free estate, with out much consideration, both as to my 
   present &amp; future; the first inclining me rather to continue
   soe still; wherein none could be more sattisfied.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The second would contract much more trouble, twisted
   inseparably with those comforts God gave in that Estate.
   Yet might I be hopefull to serve God in those duties in-
   -combant on a, Wife, A mother, a mistresse, &amp; governesse
   in a Family. And if it pleased God soe to dispose of me
   in marriage makeing me a more publicke instrument of
   good to those severall relations. I thought it rather duty
   in me to accept my freinds desires for a joynt binefitt, then
   my own single retired content, soe that Allmighty God
   might receave the Glory of my change, &amp; I more capacita-
   ted to serve him in this Generation. in what he thus called
   me unto. // </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Therefore itt highly conserned me to enter into this great
   -est Change of my life with abundance of feare &amp; caution.
   not lightly, nor unadvisedly, nor as, I may take my
   God to witnesse that knowes the secrett of hearts; I did it not
   to fullfill the lusts of the flesh. but in chastity, &amp; singlenesse
   of heart, as marrieing in the Lord. </p>






121.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And to that end, that I might have a blessing uppon
   me, in all my undertakeings. I powred out my pettitions
   before the God of my Life. to direct; strengthen, leade
   &amp; counsell me what to doe in this conserne, which soe
   much tended to my future comfort or discomfort.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And to order my waies aright, soe that if he saw in his
   wisdome that the married estate was the best for me that he
   would please to direct me in it. &amp; incline my heart
   towards it; but if otherwise it were best for me to be,
   that I might still contineue in the same. but still referring
   my will to his. And allso to order my change, that hee soe
   would in mercy give me such a one, to be my husband
   as might be an holy good &amp; pious Christian. und-
   -erstanding, wise &amp; affectionate. that we might live in his
   feare &amp; favour. praing him to give unto me sutable
   graces &amp; qualifications, which should fitt me for that
   calling. &amp; this for our Saviours Sake I humbly begged
   in Jesus Christ our Lord Amen.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After which pettions to my God. I was the more inclined to
   accept of this proposition, of my freinds. finding allso
   that the Gentleman seemed to be a very godly sober &amp;
   discreet Person. free from all manner of vice, &amp; of a 
   good conversation. this was the greatest incouragement
   to me. when I considered the generall decay of true
   Religion, in profession &amp; practice. Especially in the Gentry
   &amp; with men of quality; too many, being given to a sad
   course of life, through debauchery. made me more
   cautious in chusing, &amp; feareing to meete with such as-
   neither knew God, nor caired for theire soules, to pre
   -serve themselves in a holy course of life &amp; conversation.
   Nor could I ever have injoyed comfort in this world to
   have bin matched with the greatest Estates.</p>






122.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Or fortunes, had I wanted that first, &amp; principall qua-
   lification in a husband, which is to be regarded above all
   the sattisfaction this world can afford.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I cannot deny that his Estate which was then favourably given
   into my Mother, was the least in valew which had bin offred
   yet did my Mother hope, to finde a hansome compotency
   with out much charge as was represented to her, only
   the want of a house which he must builde, his brother &amp; sister
   beeing provided for by his mother that would cleare his
   Estate. which was given in to be 600l per annum.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This was very well; considering the addittion of my
   Fathers Portion given me by his will, &amp; deeds, namly
   1500l out of England, at Kirklington; and 1000l to be
   paid out of his Irish Estate of Edough. which would be
   an addittion to increase Mr Thorntons Reveneus. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Allso my deare mother was willing to give me what
   assistance she could out of her love &amp; affection.
   This treaty of marriage with Mr Thornton, was very 
   earnestly pursued by himselfe &amp; freinds, &amp; as dis-
   creetly mannaged by my deare mother, as she could
   for she was in a manner left alone, by all our relations
   Especially. affter my brothers death, in regard that selfe
   intresst too farre prevaild, for those to hinder my
   disposall to any Person, by the 
   
   <p> [word] Checked in original, stet.</p>
    which they would be deprivd
   of theire sinister expectations of my fortune. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But through Gods blessing this treaty was brought
   to a period, to the sattisfaction of each party, &amp; with a
   generall consent, And The Articles of marriage drawne
   up by Mr Thornton, for the right settlement of all things

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I looked upon this first beginning of my new condition

Meditations upon my deliverance of my first
Childe &amp; of the great sickness followed for 3 quarters of a yeare
August 6th 1652 lasted till May: 12. 53.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">About seaven weekes affter I married. itt pleased
   God to give me the blessing of conseption. the first
   quarter I was exceeding sickly in breeding, till I
   was with quicke childe. Affter which I was very strong
   &amp; healthy I blesse God. only much hotter then formerly
   as is usuall in such cases from a naturall cause.
   in soe much that my nose bled much when I was about
   halfe gon by reason of the increase of heate.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Mr Thornton had a desire that I should vissitt his freinds
   in which I frely joyned. his mother liveing about 50 miles
   from Hipswell, &amp; all at Newton, And Buttercrambe
   In my passage thither I sweat exceedingly, &amp; was
   much inclining to be feavorish, wanting not 8 weeks
   of my time. so that Dr Wittie said that I should goe neare to fall
   into a feaver, or some desperate sicknesse, If I did not
   coole my blood, by takeing some away. &amp; if I had staied
   but 2 daies longer, I had followed his advice.</p>






128.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In his returne home from Newton his owne Estate, I was
   carried over Hambleton towards Sir Will.m Akoughs house
   where I passed downe on foote a very high hill, betwixt
   hud hill &amp; whitsonclife, which is a bove a mile steepe downe
   &amp; indeed so bad, that I could not scarse tread the narrow steps
   which was exceeding bad for me in that condittion, &amp; sore to in-
   -dure the way soe strait &amp; none to leade me but my maide,
   which could scarse make shift to gett downe her selfe. All our
   company beeing gon downe before, each step did very much
   streine me being soe bigg with childe. nor could I have gott downe
   if I had not then bin in my full strength &amp; nimble on foote. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But I blesse God I gott downe safe att last though much tired
   &amp; hott &amp; weary, finding my selfe not well, but troubled with 
   paines affer my walke: Mr Thornton would not have
   brought me that way if he had knowne it soe dangerous. &amp; I
   was a strainger in that place. but he was advised by some to 
   goe that way before we came downe the hill. </p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This was the first occassion which brought me a great deale of
   Misery &amp; killed my sweete infant in my wombe. For I contineu
   -ued in all paine by fitts upon this jorney. &amp; with in a fortnight
   fell into a desperate feaver att Hipswell. upon which my old Dr
   Mr Mahum was called. but could doe little towards the cure.
   because of beeing with childe. I was willing to be ordered by him but
   said I found it absolutely necessary to be lett blood if they
   would save my life. but I was freely willing to resigne my
   will to Gods, if he saw fitt for me, to spaire my life yet to live 
   with my husband. but still with subservency to my heavenly father</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nor was I wanting to suplicate my God for direction what to
   doe either for life or death. I had very offten &amp; frequent
   impusions to desire the later before the former finding noe true
   Joy in this Life. but I confesse also that which moved me to use all
   meanes for my Recovery in regard of the great sorrow of my
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   129. 
   
   Deare &amp; Aged Mother, &amp; my deare husband, tooke
   for me, farre exceeding my deserts made me more willing
   to save my Life for them, &amp; that I might render praises
   to my God in the land of the liveing. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> But truly I found my ♡ still did cleave soe much
   to my Maker, that I never found my selfe more desirous of
   a change. to be delivered from this wicked world &amp; bodie
   of sin &amp; death, desiring to be disolved &amp; to be with Christ </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Therefore indured I all the Rigour, &amp; extreamity of my
   sicknesse, with such a shaire of Patience, as my God gave me.
   As for my freinds they were soe much conserned for me
   that upon the importunity of my husband, allthough I
   was brought indeed very weake &amp; desperately ill about, 
   11th day of my sicknesse. I did lett him send for Dr wittie
   if it were not too late. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Dr came Post the next day. when he found me very
   weake, &amp; durst not, lett me blood that night. but gave me
   cordialls &amp; till the next day, &amp; if I gott but one houers
   rest that night he would doe it the morning following. that night
   the two Drs had a dispute about the letting me blood. Mr Mahum
   was against it &amp; Dr wittie for it. but I soone desided
   that dispute &amp; tould them if they would save my life
   I must bleed. soe the next day I had 6 or 7 ounces taken which
   was turned very bad by my sicknesse. but I found a
   change immeadiatly in my sight which was exceding dime
   before, &amp; then I see as well as ever clearly. &amp; my strength
   began a little to returne; these things I relate that I may
   sett forth the mercy of my ever gracious God, who had blessed
   the meanes in such manner. who can sufficiently Extoll
   his Majestie for his boundlesse mercys to me his weake Creatue
   
   <p> [word] SiC – i.e., creature.</p>
   
   
   For from that time I was better &amp; hee had hopes of my Life</p>

   Poor infant with in me was greatly forced with violent
   Motions perpetually, till it grew soe weake that it had left
   stirring, &amp; about the 27th of August, I found myselfe in 
   great paines as it were the colick. affter which I began to be
   in travill. And about the next day att night I was de-
   -livered of a goodly daughter; who lived not soe long as
   that we could gett a minister to baptize it though we 
   presently sent for one. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> This my sweete babe &amp; first Childe departed this life halfean 
   houer affter its birth. beeing receaved, I hope into the Armes
   of him that gave it. she was buried that night beeing friday the
   27th of August. 1652. att Easby Church.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The effects of this feaver remained by severall distempers
   successively. first affter the Miscarriage. I fell into a most
   tirrable shakeing Ague lasting one quarter of a yeare. by fitts
   each day twice in much violency, so that the sweats was great
   with faintings. beeing thereby weakened till I could not stand or goe.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After the Ague left me upon a medicin of London Treacle
   I fell into the Jandies, 
   
   <p> [word] I.e., jaundice.</p>
    which used me very hardly one full
   q.r &amp; a halfe more. I finding Dr witties judgment true that 
   it would prove a cronicall distemper. but blessed be the
   Lord upon great &amp; many meanes used &amp; all remidies. I
   was at length cured of all distempers &amp; weaknesses which
   from its begining had lasted 3 quarter of a yeare full out. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thus I had a sad entertainment &amp; begining of my Change
   of life the comforts thereof beeing turned into much dis-
   comforts &amp; weaknesses. but still I was upheld by an All-
   mighty Power. therefore will I praise the Lord my God. Amen.</p>

Meditations uppon the birth of my 3d Childe Eliz.
Thornton borne the 14th of February. 16554.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I recovered not very well, of the extreame weakenesse
   that followed for a quarter of a yeare affter my childe, in soe
   much that my milke was taken from me &amp; soe I was hin-
   -dred from doeing the naturall duty incumbant upon us
   mothers which troubled me much; but I must be willing
   to submitt to all Gods pleasure in every thing.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At some time my strength returned againe And through
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   138. 
   
   Mercy I conceaved of another childe haveing somewhat
   a better time in breeding it and did fully intend by Gods
   blessing to nurse it my selfe if I had strength;</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
   About a weeke before my full time I contineued in much
   paine through the heavinesse of my Childe; haveing the mid-
   -wife in constant expectation each houer. att which time
   my deare mother laid sicke in the house of a sad cough. &amp;
   yong Mrs Troutbeck came to give her directions through
   some freinds advice. &amp; by the blessing of God she was recov
   -ered though not to be with me in my travell. all teusday
   &amp; that night with the morning on wednesday I was in great ex-
   -treamity till I was delivered. which came to passe on wednesday
   the 14th of february. halfe houer affter 11 a clocke in the forenoone
   of a very sweete goodly daughter, &amp; a delicate childe, for
   which most gracious mercy in my deliverance with my infants
   I render most faithfull &amp; infinitt thanks to the great &amp; mighty
   God of heaven &amp; earth which had compassion on me in my extrea
   -mity.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After I was delivered &amp; in bed at 9 a clocke at night.
   it fell out that my little daughter naly, then newly weaned
   &amp; being asleepe in the cradle fell into a desperate fitt of
   the convoltions, as it was suposed to be, her breath stoping
   &amp; grew blackish in her face. which did sore afright her maide
   Jane Flouer, whoe immeadiatly tooke her up &amp; with Jane
   Rimer the midwife made helpe to recover her life. but all
   that night she was soe exceeding weake that my Aunt Norton
   satt with her &amp; many others expecting when she would have
   died.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During this poore childes illnesse, I was allmost at deaths
   dore my selfe. by a great Ilnes comeing affter I was in bed
   soe that my Aunt &amp; freinds did immagine I could not live
   nor durst they tell me how weake my sweete Naly was at
   that time least griefe should have dispatched me hence.
   but they removed her in the cradle into the Parlour.</p>






139.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This ill fitt hindered my milke much. but yet affter
   -wards I recruted fast. &amp; within a fortnight had gotten
   the milke againe into my breasts &amp; my deare babe Betty
   did sucke every day of me &amp; I was over joyed in that 
   great blessing. /. But it is usually soe with me that I have
   my comforts mixed with sadnesse. &amp; many times my in
   -joyments are woven with crosses. &amp; sorrowes.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For at the fortnights end. I was sitting in a chaire &amp; giving
   my childe sucke, when immeadiatly one of the maides
   cried out of the nurrsery that My childe Naly was either
   dead or dieing, which soe affrighted me beeing but weake
   that an Ilnesse cam in force on me as I satt. &amp; there was much
   to doe to gett me safe in to my bed, &amp; there kept, betwixt
   hopes &amp; feares for my selfe &amp; childe 2 daies. or more.
   but at the length. through exceeding much mercy &amp;
   love of my God he brought us both from those weaknes
   &amp; I recovered strength in time. and Naly had an
   eye Tooth which broake flesh that had bin the cause of all that
   danger to her. and offten affterwards when her teeth
   was cutting the gumes she was ill againe till she had
   gott them all.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But this second weaknesse of my owne did soe dis-
   -courage my deare mother, that she would not lett me
   give sucke, although I extreamely desired it, &amp; att
   the months end I was forced to drie my breasts which grew
   full &amp; had indangered to bring me ill againe.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And Dafeny Lightfoote gave my betty sucke. till she
   proved with childe: which afterwards was the cause I put her
   to annother at about 3 quarter of a yeare old; but she did not deale
   well with my childe which was a most stately lovely girle
   when she tooke her to nurse. nor was I able to goe soe
   offten then to see her because it was a mile off Hipswell
   &amp; I was then with childe, so that I durst not adventure a 
   great walke or to ride when I grew so bigg.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Elizabeth Thornton my third Childe was borne att Hipsw

   but upon the Wednesday the ninth of December I fell into
   exceeding sharpe travill in great extreamity so that the
   midwife did beleive I should be delivered soone.
   but loe it fell out contrary. for the childe staied in the

   had such sore travell in danger of my life soe long and the

   wrong by the fall I gott in Sept before, nor had the midwife
   skill to turne him right, which was the cause of the losse of his Life
   And the hazard of my owne. </p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The weakenesse of my bodie was exceeding great of long
   contineuance that it put me into the beginnig of a consum-

My Cure of Bleeding at Scarbrough August. 1659. // .


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It was the good pleasure of God to contineue me most
   wonderfully, though in much weakenesse, affter that excessive
   losse of Blood &amp; spiritts, in Childe bed, with the contineuance
   of lamenesse aboue 20 weekes affter, and the losse of blood
   &amp; strength by the bleeding of the Hemorides, which followed
   every day by seige and was caused by my last travell
   &amp; torment in Childebirth. which brought me soe low &amp; weake
   that I fainted allmost every day uppon such occasions.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And it was the opinion of Dr wittie that I was deeply gon in
   a Consumption. and if that contineued longer, I should be
   barren. All which beeing considered by my deare husband
   &amp; mother. they were resolved from the Drs oppinion that I 
   should goe to Scarbrough spaw
   
   <p> [word] I.e., spa</p>
    for the cure of the said 
   distemper, &amp; accordingly, I went with Mr Thornton staing

   God recover my strength. affter the stay of the former
   infirmity, of bleeding it leaving me with in 2 daies, totally
   &amp; was cleared from those faintings this carried along with it
   returning to Oswoldkirdke by my Sister Denton homewards </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After this great cure which the spaw wrought on me, for which
   I most humbly returne my hearty &amp; faithfull acknowledg-ment

   my Deare Mother some what recovered of a very

   fitt of the stone in which she had bin in great danger about
   2 daies before. and had sent for me home, her servant meeting
   me at my sister Crathornes, in my way to Hipswell; I was very
   Joyfull to find her any thing recruted from her extreamity
   blessed be the Lord most high, which had compassion on my deare
   Mother in raiseing her from death, &amp; easing her from those
   violent fitts of paine &amp; torment, giveing her to me. &amp; spairing
   my life allso from that languishing sicknesse caused by my Child
   -birth, &amp; might have caused my Death.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">About this August after our returne from Scarbrough
   it pleased God to give me much strength &amp; health,
   soe that I conceaved with Childe; which affter Mr Thornton
   perceived, he with my mother greatly rejoyced; hope-
   -ing that I might at length be blessed with a son. //.
   For 4 monthes together, I injoyed a great deale of
   comfort &amp; health, beeing much stronger &amp; lively
   when I was with my Sons then Daughters, haveing
   great cause to admire the goodnesse of God, which even
   contrary unto hope caused me to recover of that sad

   extraordinary patience. still saing, it was the
   Lord that sent it to her, &amp; none else could take it from
   her, &amp; if he pleased to see it fitt, he could ease her

   she said of our meeting againe. never to part; which soe 
   hapened, for I was affter this even desirous that if it were

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I began a dangerous Sicknesse, which brought me very nigh
   to Death; att Oswoldkirke affter my deare mothers death.
   which was caused by that Cold I gott. &amp; Aguish Temper on the
   Sunday in the Church; causing a very violent vomitting

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">He saw cause to let me blood, giveing me many Cordialls
   to strengthen the stomacke; but noething would stay with me.
   Till I dranke a draught of cold water, which more refreshed
   my Thirsty Soule; then all what Art could give.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">That night beeing the 17th of feb. I did veriely believe, sho
   should be my last in this Life; I beeing brought into an
   Exceeding weakenesse &amp; feeblenesse of Bodie &amp; spiritt.
   But most of all into a seeming Spirituall dessertion 
   from God: which was not to be long indured. with out sinking
   under the Pressures of the devine displeasure. Which I apprehe-
   -nded in this my weakenesse. my Etternall State to be in a 
   Lost condittion, by reason of my Sinnes; And Satans 
   Accusing me falsely from my sorrowes, &amp; temporall sufferings
   Casting multitude of doubtings into my heart. As that
   Surely I did not belong to God. And I was not his Servant
   because he followed me with such crosses, Afflicktions, sicknes
   &amp; troubles in this world; which seemed to be Curses; rather then
   such trialls, as he used to lay upon those that were his Children.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And that I had neglected, al those offers, &amp; tenders of mercy
   in his word &amp; Sacraments, which he from time to time, had given
   me from my youth up. in the examples, instructions &amp; admoniti
   ons from my deare Parents, &amp; from his, ministers; All his
   great deliverances. &amp; checks, &amp; calls of his spiritt. with his
   spirittuall &amp; temporall preservations of me innumerable.
   (Yet said Satan) All these had not wrought a through conver

   of Gods spiritt with that strictnes I ought to have don. &amp; that though

   I had bin kept from the falling into any innormous sinns,
   yet for the Least ommittion of duties; or smale offencees a-
   gainst God or man Etternall damnation was due; And that
   now it was too late to (repent) or hope, because I had neglec-

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For ought I know this was my last Sommones. And that all 
   though God was able to have mercy upon me: Yett I had
   soe offten failed my promises, &amp; fallen into sinns &amp; forgettf
   -ulnesse of God; That he now would not have mercy on me
   at the last houer; As satan would haue perswaded me.
   These with many arguments against my poore Soule: did
   the old Serpent seeke to destroy my hopes of mercy. &amp; my
   owne weaknesse &amp; malancholy forming against my selfe
   joyning with Satan; in feares because of my unworthinesse
   or ingratitude;</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Loe in this most sad &amp; heavy condittion was I in; not
   haveing any soule living that I could open my greifes &amp; thou-

   heavy spiritt; for that time Mr Thornton; was himselfe in a sad
   condittion, &amp; very malencoly full of trouble of spiritt, nor
   would I acquaint him least I should be an agravation of
   his trouble. And Alass, what could I say in this exigent
   When the God of Mercy: by his corrections seveare, had 
   seemed to forsake me. &amp; with draw his presence; The Deivill
   Accusing: as he is tearmed the accuser of the brethren, my
   concience could not excuse me from too many failings.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">My sicknesse &amp; weakenesse threatning my desolation each
   Minuitt; and I had none to give me Spirittuall comfort
   And my soule was sad even to the death; Yet in this exigent
   whither could I flye for releife; but to that Great God which made
   heaven &amp; Earth: I desired to cast my selfe soley at his
   feete, of mercy; yea before the Throne of the most gracious God
   in whome I live &amp; move, &amp; have my beeing, saieing with Eat
   Easter

      “I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which
      is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.”
      </p>
    if I perish, I perish. heere I am, Lord though thou 
   shouldest kill me, yet will I trust in thee, for healing, 
   pardoning, strengthning grace &amp; mercy. Immeadiately upon
   these thoughts, It pleased him in a wonderous manner to be
   -gin to give me some comfort from sinkeing in my hopes, &amp; to
   stay my selfe on him, when I was allmost past hopes by reason
   of my weaknesse. this I obteined out of that

      lowly in heart: and yee shall find rest vnto your soules.For my yoke is easie, and
      my burden is light.’</p>
    which like the

   into the secrett darkenesse of my sorrowfull heart &amp; dejected
   soule; bringing refreshment &amp; some hopes of releife &amp; comfort
   beeing increased in the consideration of those heavenly mercys
   conteined in that scripture. Lookeing upon this as his sweete
   &amp; effectuall call to my soule, wherein he then bid me come

   to releive all poore sinfull dejected soules, which Laboured &amp;

Uppon our comeing to live att newton affter the house was
built in the yeare 1662. June the 10th


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At the last, affter 6 yeares worke at the dwelling house of
   Mr Thornton Easte newton. haveing builded it from the
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   194. 
   
   Ground: It pleased God to give us all leave, with our
   family &amp; two daughters to come to live at it beeing
   soe finished, as to dwell therein about the midest of June
   1662. I beeing then great with Childe walked from oswold
   kirke with our company. haveing a great deale of strength
   &amp; health given to me from God. Blessed bee his holy name.
   Also he gave us a comfortable settlement at our owne house
   which I gott ready furnished with what my deare mother gave
   me in 5 daies time. And all the ground stocked with her Cattell.</p>



<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After which, with in a little of our commeing to house: Mr
   Thornton was called to London by nettletons bussinesse
   goeing purposely to prevent the breakeing up an Excecu
   -tion against him from that Nettleton against his Estate
   
   
   for a debt of my fathers, which Mr Thornton had bin ad-
   vised by some to secure out of his owne Estate: &amp; to in-
   gage for it, soe till he could receave the monnyis from
   Ireland out of my Fathers Estate there, which was by his
   Leace for 41 yeares apoynted to pay all Debts Legacys
   &amp; Portions in feoffee in trusts hands, &amp; he had bin advised
   formerly to take upon him the mannegment of it from 
   my Uncle Mr Norton by way of Assignment. &amp; to pay
   those things chargeable thereupon; but albeit there was
   a good Estate, which was 1000l per Annum.
   
   <p> [word] SiC – no expansion.</p>
    there from whence
   these debts should arrise; yet it was altogether against
   my deare mothers, or my owne judgement or advice that he
   should take uppon him soe great a trouble as that must be
   both in regard that neither his Purse nor person was suting such 
   an enterprise. beeing in annother nation soe a hazard to
   his Person; &amp; likewise not suited in other respects to with
   stand the disputes, which she foresee would arrise from some
   that were conserned for themselves. Nor was there the least 
   necessity for him to ingage in it for gaining my 1000l there
   by reason both that &amp; all other rights &amp; dues which could be
   challenged by my mother &amp; my selfe were sufficiently
   secured to us by my deare fathers Last Will &amp; Deeds. &amp;
   non could prejudice us therein. what ever sinister pre-
   tensions were made by others whos advice he unhapily
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   195. 
   
   followed: as it affter wards appeared. And besides my
   English Portion was suficiently &amp; undoubtedly safe &amp; se
   cured to him; of 1500l by the will &amp; Leace from my uncle Will.
   Wandesforde out of Kirklington. &amp; by Articles 3 partite
   before my marriage betwixt My uncle Wand. my Brother
   Christopher &amp; my selfe securing both the 1500l &amp; the 1000l out
   of Ireland in its due order to be paid.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But it soe hapned that he was advised with out our knowledge
   or consent as aforesaid to ingage to Nettleton, (as well as
   to the bussinesse of the Assignement) for a Debt of 1000l Payable
   out of his owne Estate by statute. 
   
    because nettleton would
   not accept of security out of Ireland: nor stay till Mr Th.
   receaved it thence; but he prosecuted Mr Th. with soe much
   violency &amp; fearcenesse; that he compelld him to borrow monnys
   to sattisfie his clamour: &amp; he had payd him 900l &amp;
   above: nor would he be sattisfied: because the bond was for a
   1000l &amp; not beeing taken in by Mr Th. he sued for the whole
   &amp; for charges. 
   
   And most unjustly &amp; deceiptfully, watch
   an oportunity when Mr Thornton was at London to have
   dispatched it. he gott an Execution broake up: and by his
   owne man, with 4 other Balifs came early in a morning; to
   seaze upon all our goods, monnys, Plate &amp; till he were all
   Sattisfied: att first very stiffely demanded 800l then to
   be payde But att last by my Brother Dentons endevours
   he knewing the debtt was paid prevailled to give them 200l
   which they would have, or Plate &amp; to that valewe. //.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This accident, was very afflicting to me, in regard that I hoped
   Mr Thorntons beeing there would have prevented it; &amp; being
   bigg with Childe, the greife I had with the fright &amp; the Rudenesse
   of those men, had nigh gon to make me misscarrie, what for
   the injustice &amp; unhansomenesse of that conserne which came soe sud-
   -ainly on me in that bussinesse. Yet the Providence of God had soe
   ordered, that there was 100l of Mr Thorntons newly the weeke be-
   fore come in: and with 57l of my owne, part of what my Mother
   gave me: that sattisfied them at present. or else it might
   haue proved fare worse with me then; in that condittion. which if
   I had wanted peradventure they might have taken my
   bed from under myselfe &amp; Children, &amp; those quick goods
   my mother gave for our Releife.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I pray God forgive all those, by whoes evill councell
   my deare husband was brought into those snaires: when
   he intended most good to all parties in the acceptation of
   the Assignement; And the very Troubles, vexsations &amp; affli
   -ctions it carried along in the whole course of Transactions
   offten times brought us into streits: &amp; great danger of my
   Life. proveing one sad ingredient to my other sorrowes:</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And indeed; I did feare some hard measure; to fall
   unawares to Mr Thornton. &amp; partly tould him my conject
   ure. offering to pay Nettleton off with those monyes my Mother gave
   me before he went to London; but he good man did not beleive
   nor could imagine that he might find such treachery in
   those Lawyers he imployed.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yett did my suspittion prove a meanes in part to arme me with
   patience to over come that trouble when it came. Thus have
   I upon every occasion; &amp; act of my Life fresh cause to
   speake good of the Lord my god. who though he pleaseth
   to suffer me to have afflictions of severall sorts; yet with
   the affliction he maketh a way to escape, and does not 
   permitt more to come on me. then he gives me strength &amp;
   assistance to goe through.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Therefore will I give thankes unto his glorious Name &amp;
   speake of his praise, in the Land of the Living. whoe hath not
   yett given me over to death &amp; bonds And I beseech his
   mercy: that for what ever trouble I endure heere from men 
   through oppression, or injure; he will indowe me with a
   double Portion of his Grace; heere to serve him with a free ♡
   &amp; patient spiritt: &amp; giveing a compotency of these outward
   injoyments for our selves &amp; childeren in this life; if it be
   his pleasure not to be burdensome to others. And in the end
   to be our Portion &amp; our inheritance for Evers Amen.</p>

   All my English Portion of 1500l that Estate of Burne Parke

   ed for the Debts: All which did amount to the somme of 3000l
   nor did the Debts of Mr Thornton amount to that somme by
   600l Neverthelesse by the sequell of all it did appeare; that
   This just &amp; honnest action of ours did exasperate such-
   with out a cause: whoe had desires that Laistrop soe well as
   the Rest of all his Personall Estate should goe for security
   Colaterall to the rest: And by that meanes nothing should
   be left at certaine for my poore yonger Children.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The case seemed very hard to me: And made me indevor 
   the more earnestly to prosecute this settlement; which yet I
   obteined, with a grand dificulty by reason of these obsta
   -cles; but at last prevailed to have it don with out the said
   contingency; nor did I intend to Alter the same with out
   great cause. which I hoped in God would not be; because there
   was soe great a somme left for his debts, &amp; was made be-
   lieve it could not be cutt of the Intaile with out my consent
   but it proved affterward the contrary, to my great greife
   &amp; allmost my utter Ruine; &amp; my Childrens.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">There was left only Newton which was my Joynture settled
   soe on my heire. that it could not be cut off with out my consent
   in passing a fine: nor was the Rents ever more cleare then
   seaven score paid a yeare. of it.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And now I hartely thanke my gracious God who gave me
   opportunity to gett this don; for the sattisfaction of my
   consience &amp; the releife of my Children; blessed be his name
   that did not take me out of this Life before: least by some
   meanes they might have bin disapointed. and I leave
   both my husband &amp; Children, all in the wise &amp; gracious
   disposittion of the Great God, humbly craveing his blessing
   upon them all for Christs sake Amen.</p>

   hast taught me by afflictions not to sett my affections on 
   things below, so much me soe wise to seeke a habitation in 
   Heaven &amp; not of this Earth or any thing in it. Oh give me
   soe sanctified an use of this affliction that I may spend non 
   of the smale inch of time unprofitably which thou givest me 
   in this miserable Life, wherein I take noe free delight &amp; Joy. 
   but by all meanes make it my bussinesse to glorifie thy name
   &amp; the gaining thy favour. with faith to beleive in thy mercys 
   And that thou hast a love for my Soule, even in these sad dispen-

   this change &amp; dissolution, that I may receave the Kingdome of 
   Heaven as a little Childe. of thy alone miritts &amp; free grace.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
   After the drinking of Scarbrough waters, Mr Thornton
   sent for me to Yorke about bussinesse with my Lord Frechvile

   expect my life. soe that he was compelld to use all his Art for
   my preservation. But it pleased God upon the use of his
   meadicens, that extreamity a little abated, he leaveing me
   in a hopefull way of Recovery, only said I must not
   expect to be restored till about the latter end of octber</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">All which time I was in continuall faintings upon the reneuall
   of that extreamity. Soe that my losse of Spiritts &amp; strength &amp;c
   was so great that it was expected I should have fallen
   into a deepe consumption. And I contineued exceeding
   feeble &amp; weake till the Candlemas following The cheife remidie

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">I was the more induced uppon this account to accept of a

   Mr Comber to my deare husband. that he would except of
   him selfe for my daughter Alice Thornton in marriage.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   219. 
   
   Whoe though her yeares were but young beeing 14th then
   yet such was his great affection towards her; that he was
   desirous to attend for her 7 yeares. if he might by his leave
   obteine her att last: haveing, discerted all other opportunitys
   for her sake &amp; the favours he had from him. And allso that what
   ever her fortune was. It should be wholey for her to use &amp; hers.
   with all he did not dispaire, but that God whoe had Preservd
   him, hitherto would provide a hansome compotency; &amp; to mak
   a better provission for My daughter. by adding to her owne.
   This proposittion was answered by a faire respect of Mr Th.
   side &amp; he was incouraged to proseed.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nor could I be sattisfied in a bussinesse of this nature. on which
   might depend the well beeing of our Familie. with out A serious &amp;
   deepe consideration of all our Affairs, &amp; the condittion that our Estate
   was in; which beeing well knowne to my Good Brother denton,
   more then to any in the world. I consulted, and advised, with

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">After the consideration of all these motives as Principally to be

   her youth we resolved to keepe it secrett till a fitter time
   when this intended bussinesse should be consumated.
   There being still an affectionate corrospondancy of these
   Persons by Chaste &amp; religious conversations in our Family.
   
   Neither was I out of hopes that Sir Christopher Wandesforde

The death of my Brother John Wandesford: De. 2d 1666.





<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It pleased God to vissitt my deare Brother John Wand.
   Att London. with his last sickenesse, beeing an Ague: joined
   with violent fitts of the stone. haveing had severall of them
   the last halfe yeare; his sicknesse contineued soe strongly
   that he was very weake in bodie. though I blesse God perfect
   in mind &amp; spiritt. I am the better able to shew the same from
   the relation of his owne servant, &amp; the People where he lived
   Testifieing this truth to Mr Comber. who was then at London
   &amp; intreated by me to vissitt my deare brother in his affliction
   at the newes of hearing of me he did much rejoyce &amp; faine
   would have seene his deare &amp; beloved sister. but when he
   understood I was in Yorkeshire. he praied them to remember
   his deare love to me. &amp; thanke me for sending to see him.
   with abundance of Testimonys of his affection &amp; love to me &amp;
   mine praing for us. then did he more Zealously prepaire for
   his change &amp; departure out of this miserable world. God have
   -ing givn him a taste of heaven &amp; happinesse.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   222. 
   
   haveing bin long since weary of it, &amp; banished from 
   the comforts of its injoyments. For severall yeares since
   my brother Georges Death he had laid under the most
   sad &amp; afflicting hand of God by reason of the want of the
   use of his understanding which came to him by a deepe
   Malancolie seising upon his spiritt Partly for the losse of
   of my said Brother. &amp; the greife he tooke upon ill usage
   in the detaining of his Annuity. he beeing of a sweete
   noble nature, it wrought the more to his Prejudice.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But I doe believe that what things of this nature, to any
   of the Prejudice, of our family, did not proceed from the
   Heires owne inclination. beeing naturally of a good
   &amp; sweete dispossittion, but from the Councell of such by
   whome he had bin acted since his Marriage. who had
   advised my bro. George to destroy the Intailes &amp; Settlements
   of his father by which he might be free to settle his Estate
   wholely upon his Daughter to the Ruine of all his Family
   but my bro. G. W. abhorred such treachery, nor ever
   harkned to such designes. nor could my bro. Christ. und
   -erstand the depth of such insinuations. not beeing experi
   enced in the transactions of bussinesse, of this nature.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(However it was.) this poore Brother was the greatest suff-

   &amp; fully restored, was againe brought downe, through troubles
   And want, he sustained. nor was it in my power to helpe
   or releive him otherwise then by my Praiers &amp; Teares for him.
   our owne sufferings beeing soe great.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Yet did the God of mercys give him many intervalls in which

   my deare mother had given him the best education she could
   sending him to Cambrige about 15 yeares old: under the
   Tuittion of Dr widdrington where he made great im-

   soe Studious. even at nights. &amp; when his hours should have
   bin for recreation: that his Tutor was forced to forbid that sever--

   very strict, in acts of Religion &amp; Pietie, Truly from his
   childhoode &amp; youth studing to serve &amp; feare God.
   
   In fine he was soe hopefully good &amp; pregnant, that my mot.
   had much comfort &amp; all his relations joy in him. beeing
   full of expectations that this early plant might flourish to

   And suffered great hardships and injuries for the want
   of somes caire over him. &amp; negligence to performe that

   could doe for him. She every yeare giveing that Dr a

On Mrs Anne Danbys goeing to Hooly. Ap. 20. 67.





<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Uppon the complaint of Mrs Danby to Mrs Batte, (then a
   servant to the young Countesse of Sussex; and accounts
   by her to be the dearest freind she had in the world) of her
   hard usuage by Mr Danby; &amp; severall discontents
   framed by her servant in my house, adding to her for-
   -mer disgust towards me in her beeing cast out as she
   said for my sake. these, with other secrett unjust reasons
   of her owne. bey these 2 persons was a mutuall compliance
   in there designes &amp; Mrs Danbys underming me in secrett
   brought Mrs Batte late at night to my house at newton
   under pretence of providing butter for Mrs Danby at the
   service att hooly to waite on that mad Countesse of Sussex
   Mrs Batt tould me. she came to fech her cosen danby a 
   away. &amp; that she would have her from me. I upon this first
   salutation beeing surpreised with her discourse as well as her
   sudaine vissitt. (which yet Mrs Danby knew of.) tould her
   againe that I had bin desirous to see her &amp; of her acquaintance
   upon my neece her account. but that she should now come
   to fettch her from me, whoes wellfaire I much wished. &amp;
   loved her company, with out giveing me any notice. I could
   not tell what to say of it. &amp; that what my poore house could
   afford towards my neeces her content, &amp; what I could doe
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   238. 
   
   For her should not be a wanting. noe more then what
   I had formerly don to my weake capacity. And I could
   not willingly part with her. hopeing that her sister upon
   my soliciting would settle her againe.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">my discourse more to this Purpose. but the other said she
   would have her away from me. Then I returned that I
   would leave it to my neece her selfe to dettermine, as she
   pleased. Upon the sunday morning. they haveing lien
   together that night. &amp; prepaired for a march to Hooly; But
   they were prevailed to stay that day, beeing every way
   unfitt to breake the sabbath. upon soe slight an occassion</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Upon discourse with Mrs Batte she said that she admired
   why all Mrs Danbys freinds, that non of them could in dure
   her of her husbands side, but I that looket at her or shewd any
   respect. I said that I could not soe well know the reason
   save that she brought noe fortune &amp; was a charge to that family
   as I had heard them say, &amp; that Sir Tho. Danby could not be
   reconsiled because of kitts marriage to her against his
   knowledge or consent. Then Mrs Batte said it was true
   that she had seene a letter in Virginia that came to Mrs Danby
   from Sir Tho. out of England, in answer to one from Mrs D.
   to him. that was Extreamly sharpe. where he tould her that
   she had inveagled his son to marry her with out his consent
   &amp; theire marriage was not Lawfull. And for her that had not
   a groate
   
   <p> [word] SiC, although presumably means great.</p>
    Portion affter such an act: to be soe Proud &amp; high
   as to require him to furnish her with silke stockings. sattin
   &amp; cloth a silver mantles &amp; other things answerable to that
   State. was more presumption then any could imagine.
   his son beeing a yonger brother &amp; soe had nothing but from
   his goodnesse. Sir Tho. D. expressing much more to her in
   that letter to this purpose. &amp; was soe incensed that he would
    
   never
   seldom
    
   see her in all his Life but shunned her at all times
   sending for his son into England with out her; I said I had
   not heard of such letters. but that Sir Tho. was much displeasd
   at me &amp; my mother for speaking for her to him &amp; said that 
   we knew her not soe well as he did. &amp; that they might curs
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   239. 
   
   time of her entrance into his Family, for the mischeife she
   had wrought in it: &amp; that match could not prosper which was
   begun in such an unlawfull manner. it had bin the grand
   discontent of his life. &amp; more to the like purpose severall
   times soe my mother, nor my selfe affter many endeavors
   could never prevale for her. yet did I allwaies commise
   -rate her condittion, whoes Person was soe qualified &amp; 
   seemed to be religious. &amp; carried soe faire in her demener
   haveing abundance of charity for her condition. haveing
   helped her with advice &amp; assistance in all things to my
   poure,
   
   <p> [word] I.e., power.</p>
    beleiving that she had bin wronged. according to her
   owne complaint. When our discource was ended. they 
   came from Church, &amp; went to dinner. Affter it was consulted
   on &amp; thought fitt to send to Mr farrer at Malton for his
   advice whether Mrs Danby might goe to Hooly as a vissitt
   who returnd by word, that he conseavd she might goe 
     
   and
   thither
     
   
   allthough he knew that place was in opposition to Madam Danby
   &amp; would displease her if she staid any time. but for a while
   she might goe as he thought with out prejudice. this she 
   conseavd was allowance. but he spoke very prudently 
   to both partys. .Then Mrs Danby was pleased as it were
   to consult as she said at least in pretence with me of her 
   goeing thither. which I could not tell how to dettermine becaus
   at that time her sister Danby was comeing into the Country &amp;
   I was to use my indeavours for her having then very
   good hopes. as allso soe had Mr Farrer who said he did
   beleive he could prevaile for 60l a yeare if she would except
   it. And with all I did not know what to advice which might
   sattisfie her. but left it to her how to dispose herselfe. for
   I tould her that as well as I could entertaine her in my house
   she should want for nothing. I would use only my uttmost with
   her sister to give a sufficient Provission for her &amp; her Children
   But doubted that her Jorney to Houly might doe harme.
   but because I could not doe her what good I would beeing soe
   loe in our Estate, I could not hinder from her better ad
   vantage. She said indeed it was much below her to goe to
   service (as Mrs Batt did counsell her) &amp; she thankt God.</p>






240.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">If she would take that course of life, she could doe better
   for her selfe, but she would goe over to see the place becaus
   it was out of mattie Batts love extoling her frindship
   to the skies &amp; much undervaleuing all my endevours &amp;
   faithfullnesse, yet did she expect this as a reserve if
   she liked not Hooly. The next morning prepared with great
   Joy to goe. &amp; when she was at breakfast exprest much
   indignation, that she was turnd out as she termd it for my
   sake from Beedall. I could answer noe otherwise then to
   shew my sorrow for it. &amp; that if she had informd me of that
   before that her sister was angery she should not have comd</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Att her goeing that morning she was highly displeased as
   (I was informed) that she spoke it to. That Mr Comber, or my 
   brother Denton, who she had much deluded with faire shew
   did not waite upon her to Hooly. And was only conduc-
   -ted by my cheife servant. &amp; 3 of the Earles men, with Mrs
   Batt &amp; her maide.</p>

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This was only a pretence, though Pride enough: for when
   I sent men &amp; horrses, to bringe her home above 60 miles
   hence on purpose. she was not pleased. because Mr Combber
   came not. but sent them backe empty save with a Letter to
   my brother Denton to invite him under pretence) but rea
   ly the others who she then prosecuted with eager designe
   for to drawe him in for a husband for Mrs Batte and in
   whose incomium she had spent soe much time &amp; paines
   to represent him with the best of Retorick to her; which at the
   first view was sufficiently forward to show her good op-
   pinion of that man. Mr Thornton was highly displeased
   that she had bin soe incivill to returne his servant Empty &amp;
   that allso he was made soe wellcome there, that he diffred not from
   a beast in his drunkenesse at that house. soe that he would not
   lett me send noe more for her.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In this time. I was soe farre from giveing her any abuse
   or remembring these injures. that Madam Danby comeing to see
   me on may: day: I soe much soclicited for her that she did
   faithfully ingage to me that for my sake, &amp; not her owne, which
   had personally disobleigd her at Beedall.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   241. 
   
   before she came to Newton. Yet she would doe what she
   could, &amp; that she would give her 60l per Annum. &amp; giue her 10l
   or 5l when she came to see her at a time &amp; give her all her goods again
   &amp; if she could doe more, she would as she was able &amp;c.
   and did Protest &amp; vowe that she did not take it ill that
   her Sister came to me but wished her to come. And that it was
   but her Plott to object that to me, to insinuate with me, &amp; to 
   Make me keepe her. for she knew not that she was with me when
   she dischargd her house. but that her owne unsufferable prid
   which would never be humbled, &amp; her Railing blacke mouthed
   wench that came to farnly and abused her there, these all
   did cause her to cast her out. and much to this purpose.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">And that she was goeing to looke into her Estate beeing the first
   time affter her husbands death. &amp; as she found she could doe for
   her she would though she did it out of her owne Estate. for
   my cause to bring them together. although they wanted for
   nothing now. Upon these tearmes passed Madam Danby &amp; my 
   selfe, concluding that I was to waite on her att Mallton at her 
   returne when she would sattisfie me better &amp; doe for her. </p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Haveing receaved this hansome and free account from Madam
   Danby I diffirred not to give ketts wife the relation of it
   by letter to Hooly purposly sending one before our last men
   went for her. And her returne for this kindenesse I have 
   related.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">But affter wards my brother Denton goeing to see his freinds
   neare Leeds, brought her backe againe to Newton. Where I did
   receave her with Joy as was my custome out of my unfeined
   love to her person. Nor could I be perswaded of her unworthy
   -nesse to meshe soe finely acting her part &amp; soe secrettly. only I
   observed abundance of hight, &amp; majestie in her deportment
   with a kinde of scorne, at her returne, rather more then usuall
   towards me. &amp; did see that then I was made use of as upon
   necessity, not affection, as was formerly much pretended.</p>


<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">My endeavours was much slighted &amp; daintily overseene.
   &amp; she highly insenced that she had not bin waited upon by
   Mr Comber, which she looked upon it, as if he slighted her
   favour &amp; rejected her freind. by not accepting that motion.</p>






242.

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Which unpardonable offence could not be passed with out 
   great indignation. yet soe secrett &amp; subtile was this acted
   , that it could not be diserned till affter the malice broke out
   publickely against me &amp; my Childe. Alice Thornton.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Lett this practice of hers be examined whether she carried

    made me beleive, nay recommended this
   match to me as in her owne Judgment &amp; choyse we woulde
   be exceeding happie in it for the did find Mr Comber to be a
   man of as great Piety &amp; Parts, incomparable. as she never
   knew in all her life, &amp; that she had solicited for him. advising
   both parties. that is to say Mr Comber &amp; my Daughter to this
   buiseniess, above 3 yeares agone. She knew allso theire affec-
   tions. &amp; the Progresse of all that conserne. &amp; with a full gaile of
   consent she went along with it as well with my brother Denton
   as our selves. All;
   Which proves it an undoubted act of displeasure conseaved
   against me, and an act of revenge, thus seeking to withdraw
   this mans intentions from the long intended match &amp; that realy
   she had excelent good oppinions of this gentleman to draw

<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Neither could I be informed of such slanders against
   me till by Mrs Danbys maides taking an occassion to fall
   out with me about the dressing the Chamber when it was very
   foule: she beeing in that womans place which they pretended
   had first raised those lies; And desiring to have bin in my
   owne maides place; sought an occassion to undermine her
   of that place; or else to give me warning to provide for one
   in hers: haveing a desire to be att liberty; which I was not un
   willing to in regard of my selfe: but because I kept her with
   me till my Nece Danby was resettled in her owne house, &amp;
   then she was to goe with her. &amp; to have don Mrs Danby a

   -nate act. by reason of theire disgusts both of the mistresse &amp;
   servant against my selfe &amp; familie. Yett it was the occa-
   -sion that brought these misteries of forgeries to my knowledge
   The maide telling me that she could tell me whoe had abused
   &amp; wronged me in my Familie; but not unlesse she went a-
   way for makeing a mischeife as she called it.</p>
<p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Upon which words I tould her; that I should have bin beholden to 
   her if she knew I was wronged, &amp; to lett me know by whom 
   but she said, noe not unlesse she went a way. I said it was 
   very hard if I could not be informed of the injury was don with out
   she went away: &amp; I would be determined by her mistresse.
   Soe finding her mistresse in the same humour having agreed to
   gether that I should not be righted by them unlesse she went a
   way. it troubled me much to see such dealing. as also that I
   was abused, as was pretended by others; when as she which
   was my freind should had; consealed the matter, to make her
   owne advantage against me. Nor should I have bin tould

   had not given either of them just occasion whom I had treated

   my service she was free to please her selfe. though I could
   bin glad she would stay while her mistris staied. Upon this

Oh groundles deeps, O love beyond degree.

But now.

Leaveing her, heere on Earth alone.
Much like a Widdow in disstresse
Washed in Teares, Teares that expresse.

To sitt in Glory, placed on his Throne.
Has he not left his pledge of love.
To thee his Loyall Spouse, his holy Dove.
Bequeathed Thee his Sanctifieing Spiritt
For to conduct thy weary steps to inheritt.
Those Everlasting Joyes he has prepared.
For thee. A Glorious Tabernacles Shaired.
Wherein noe Sun needs Shine, for he alone.

What then if through a Sea of brinie Teares
Thou swime’st, hee’l free thee from all feares.
Of Sinking, canst thou but hold him fast

Against the feares of Death.
Since natures workes be good and Death doth serve
As natures worke. why should we feare to die.
Since feare is vaine, but when it may preserve.
Why should we feare, that which we cannot flie.
Feare is more paine than is the paine. it feares.
Disarming humaine mindes of Native might;
While each conseipt an ugly figure beares
Which weare not Evill, well vieued in reasons light
Our only Eyes, which dimm’d, with Passions be,
Anr life is but a stepe in dusty way.
Then lett us hold, the blisse of gracious minde.
Since this wee feele. greatt losse we cannot finde.



O Death I will be thy Death. O Grave I will be thy
Victory. thanks be to God: through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The King of Heaven soe dearely loved,
As mercy beyond measure proved:

As never, were true Christians freinds.
Noe passions should my Spiritt vexe
Nor sorrow soe my mind perplex.
But I should still all glory give
Unto my God by whom I live.
And to the Glory of his Name
Through out the world divulge the same.
My walke should be but in his waies
My talke but onely in his Praise.
My Life a death, but in his love.
My death a life for him to prove.
My caire to keepe a Consience cleane.
My will from vaine thoughts to waine.
