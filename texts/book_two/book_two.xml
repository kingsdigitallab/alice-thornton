         <!-- NOTES ON DATES:
         
               NB: our main problem is that Alice does not consistently start the year on 1 Jan (NS) or 25 Mar (OS); occasionally we can't work out which year (of the two possible) a date between 1 Jan and 24 March is supposed to be in.
         
         following MoEML, three @datingMethod/@calendar
         #JulianJan year starts 1 January 
         #JulianMar date=1 Jan-24 Mar and year starts 25 March
         #JulianSic (rare) only used where date =1 Jan-24 Mar and we don't know which of the two possible years it is
         ***UPDATE: added to Book 3***
         Book 3 contains a number of dates written in the form 1668/9 (=1669). 
         #JulianSlash to differentiate from other dates, but the @*-custom attribute is encoded as per JulianJan, eg 1 Jan 1668/9 is encoded as 1669-01-01
         
         ** JulianJan is treated as default datingMethod so not explicitly encoded (at the moment)**
         ** Julian calendar is treated as the default calendar, so not explicitly encoded (atm)** 
         ** use @-custom attributes with -iso style formatting
         NB year-only dates are assumed #JulianJan unless clear reason to do otherwise
         
         <calendar> will need proper description later

     Transcription notes:
         Page \d+ in comments = Transcriber added correct page numbers -> <pb n='x'> 
         (fw=pageNum are Alice's written numbers which can be incorrect and may not appear on every page)
         
         in addition to endnotes this file has a few Word comments which are <note> place=comment.
         
     xml comments:
         NOTE: a comment on something, but shouldn't need any further (or very minor, low-priority) action.
         TODO: needs work; I probably know what's needed
         Q: needs work, uncertain about how to proceed
         
         TODO/Q [teams] - discussion on MS Teams; transcription updates, contractions, convention changes, etc to be completed later
         
         [tags] for some indication of what it's about
         [endnote] moved from Word endnotes into xml comment
      
     notes on names linkage (at end of Sept '22)
      - most people names are now tagged in all four books 
      - nearly all tagged <persName> are linked to people masterlist db 
      - (additional bk2/3 people bios in progress)
      TODO
      - at least half of people tagged with <rs> (type=person/group) have not yet been linked to the db; I'll review these but some will not be identifiable and they're generally lower priority
      - completion of people.xml standoff to include relationships - to be done once bios have been completed
      
      2022-07-20. *not* added mnote xml:ids to this book as there is no tagging that requires it. ok, there's one!
