         <!-- ENCODING NOTES
               
     Transcription notes:
         Page \d+ in comments = Transcriber added correct page numbers -> <pb n='x'> 
         (fw=pageNum are Alice's written numbers which can be incorrect and may not appear on every page)
         
         in addition to endnotes this file has a few Word comments which are <note> place=comment.
         
     xml comments:
         NOTE: a comment on something, but shouldn't need any further (or very minor, low-priority) action.
         TODO: needs work; I probably know what's needed
         Q: needs work, uncertain about how to proceed
         
         TODO/Q [teams] - discussion on MS Teams; transcription updates, contractions, convention changes, etc to be completed later
         
         [tags] for some indication of what it's about
         [endnote] moved from Word endnotes into xml comment

      2022-07-20. *not* added mnote xml:ids to this book as there is no tagging that requires it.
