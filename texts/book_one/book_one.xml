<add> (addition) contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector. 

<del> (deletion) contains a letter, word, or passage deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector. 

Where the addition and deletion are regarded as a single substitution, they can be grouped together using the <subst> (substitution) element . 

Where a word has been supplied by the editor, <supplied> can be used. 

When missing text cannot be confidently reconstructed, the <gap> element should be used. Its @reason attribute explains the reason for the omission and its @extent and @unit attributes indicate its presumed size. 

Use <unclear> if the text has been rendered partly illegible by deletion or damage so that the text can be read but without perfect confidence. 

The <damage> element should be used to indicate areas of damage affecting the text, but normally where at least some of the text can be read with confidence.

                <!-- CB:
                I've been looking at the Middleham passage and trying to work out where A was coming from and I think Ray's ordering of Bk 1's back matter in the main text is nearly as confusing as AT's own dating. I have found some key dates which should help us sort out what is going on post Chester [in the original list I just said sub-events!]. 
                They leave Chester 28 aug 1643. 
                it looks like they were briefly in Richmond with the Nortons [sept 15 1643; & this is where the lobster incident happens]. 
                then in Snape, which is where A's sister lives, 11 oct 43 for 'a year'. 
                they try to go to York in 44 but are turned back (marston moor is 2 july 1644; york under siege 11 april-2 july 44) 
                and end up at kirklington and stay with mr daggett. 
                move to hipswell nov 29 1644 [she dates some hipswell events 43 44 but this date suggests 64+]. 
                so when at goes to middleham to help katherine have a baby it was 43/4. 
                katherine isn't at snape as that isn't safe. so is A coming from kirklington? That is the only way I can make sense of why she might be crossing the Swale to get to Middleham!
