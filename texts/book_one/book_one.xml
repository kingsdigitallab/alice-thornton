            <!-- NOTES ON DATES:
         
            NB: our main problem is that Alice does not consistently start the year on 1 Jan (NS) or 25 Mar (OS); occasionally we can't work out which year (of the two possible) a date between 1 Jan and 24 March is supposed to be in.
         
         following MoEML, three @datingMethod/@calendar
         #JulianJan year starts 1 January 
         #JulianMar date=1 Jan-24 Mar and year starts 25 March
         #JulianSic (rare) only used where date =1 Jan-24 Mar and we don't know which of the two possible years it is
         ***UPDATE: added for Book 3***
         Book 3 contains a number of dates written in the form 1668/9 (=1669). 
         #JulianSlash to differentiate from other dates, but the @*-custom attribute is encoded as per JulianJan, eg 1 Jan 1668/9 is encoded as 1669-01-01
         
         ** JulianJan is treated as default datingMethod so not explicitly encoded (at the moment)**
         ** Julian calendar is treated as the default calendar, so not explicitly encoded (atm)** 
         ** use @-custom attributes with -iso style formatting
         NB year-only dates are assumed #JulianJan unless clear reason to do otherwise
         
         <calendar> will need proper description later

       @rend markers
         (mainly?) <div> or <head>  
         ruled lines above and below titles are based on WWP rendition styles
         pre/post
         double
         pattern
         thick
         BoR original format (based on wwp?): position-marker type-width-weight eg
            pre-rule-full-width-light  
            post-diagonal-short
         <milestone> (unit=rule?) i thikn these might need some more work...
         diagonal
         diagonal-left-margin
         horiz-short-right
       ** am I going to have to check all these again? found some erroneous pre/post. :-| **
         
       events tagging:
           milestone/anchor pairs
            - not yet implemented @spanTo or linking event mentions 
                - probably won't do that until the autumn after all 4 books are marked up 
            - at present milestone/anchor pairs are linked using @n, prefix "ev".
            
            **milestone/anchor pairs are not always siblings, not always in the same paragraph**
            but they *are* always in the same <div> 
            they can be "nested" for sub-events. 
            they can potentially overlap. etc.

                  - and for now, add dates to the text somehow, can use empty date tags if there are no relevant words

              this initially seems to suggest they went straight to snape

               but then "richmond to snape 11 Oct"
               so did they arrive at *richmond* on 2 sept (then alice got ill, so they had to wait until she was well enough to travel)

             Shrove Sunday can be (allegedly) either "Septuagesima Sunday" (3rd Sunday before Ash Wednesday") *or* Quinquagesima, Sun before Ash Wed.
                Ians English Calendar (ecclestiastical yr starting 1 Jan)
                1661 - Ash Wed= 27 Feb Quinq... = 24 Feb Septuagesima = *10 Feb*.
                1662 - Ash Wed= 12 Feb *Q = 9 Feb* Sept = 26 Jan.
                
                they were at Oswoldkirk from June 1660
                the next set of dates is the move to E.Newton June 1662.
                so in chronology could be 1661 or 1662
                but mention of pregnancy seems to make it 1662.
