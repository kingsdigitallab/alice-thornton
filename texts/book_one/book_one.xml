            <!-- NOTES ON DATES:
         
            NB: our main problem is that Alice does not consistently start the year on 1 Jan (NS) or 25 Mar (OS); occasionally we can't work out which year (of the two possible) a date between 1 Jan and 24 March is supposed to be in.
         
         following MoEML, three @datingMethod/@calendar
         #JulianJan year starts 1 January 
         #JulianMar date=1 Jan-24 Mar and year starts 25 March
         #JulianSic (rare) only used where date =1 Jan-24 Mar and we don't know which of the two possible years it is
         ***UPDATE: added for Book 3***
         Book 3 contains a number of dates written in the form 1668/9 (=1669). 
         #JulianSlash to differentiate from other dates, but the @*-custom attribute is encoded as per JulianJan, eg 1 Jan 1668/9 is encoded as 1669-01-01
         
         ** JulianJan is treated as default datingMethod so not explicitly encoded (at the moment)**
         ** Julian calendar is treated as the default calendar, so not explicitly encoded (atm)** 
         ** use @-custom attributes with -iso style formatting
         NB year-only dates are assumed #JulianJan unless clear reason to do otherwise
         
         <calendar> will need proper description later

      WORK IN PROGRESS   
      
      convert <pb> @n to Alice page numbers?
         
       @rend markers
         (mainly) <div> <head> occasionally <p> <fw>
         ruled lines above and below titles are based on WWP rendition styles
         pre/post()
         rule  (assumed default is full width, single ruled line)
         plus:
         _double / _pattern (these two should be mutually exclusive)
         _thick (can be added to rule or to rule_double, unlikely with pattern
         _short + _left/right - short rules, usually less than 1/4 width of page
         
         
         <milestone> 
         diagonal - short diagonal slash
         rule - full width ruled line
         ...

     ** am I going to have to check all these again? found some erroneous pre/post. not too sure about reliability of my grasp on left/right either :-| **
         
       events tagging:
           milestone/anchor pairs
            - not yet implemented @spanTo or linking event mentions 
                - probably won't do that until the autumn after all 4 books are marked up 
            - at present milestone/anchor pairs are linked using @n, prefix "ev".
            
            **milestone/anchor pairs are not always siblings, not always in the same paragraph**
            but they *are* always in the same <div> 
            they can be "nested" for sub-events.
            they can potentially overlap. etc.
         
         
         notes to self...
         check out <decoNote> for teiHeader?

    
      notes on names linkage (at end of Sept '22)
      - most people names are now tagged in all four books 
      - nearly all tagged <persName> are linked to people masterlist db 
      - (additional bk2/3 people bios in progress)
      TODO
      - at least half of people tagged with <rs> (type=person/group) have not yet been linked to the db; I'll review these but some will not be identifiable and they're generally lower priority
      - completion of people.xml standoff to include relationships - to be done once bios have been completed

        <!-- NOTE [bib] biblical example <quote> tag using @source attribute for bible citation. (because @source is used here it's not necessary to mark up "Psal. 147" in text, but could use <ref>)
            @source format maybe: Bookname_chapnum / Bookname_chapnum_versenum. use hyphens, commas if a list. (spaces are allowed)
            @type - might have started list of quote types (direct, paraphrase etc) in teams doc.
      feels like this needs *two* types: 
        direct = type of quote; biblical = bibliographical type. 
        type and subtype seems wrong, because they're not hierarchical.
        If the only thing we use <quote> for is biblical it's not a problem...

               key dates which should help us sort out what is going on post Chester 
                They leave Chester 28 aug 1643. 
                it looks like they were briefly in Richmond with the Nortons [sept 15 1643; & this is where the lobster incident happens]. 
                then in Snape, which is where A's sister lives, 11 oct 43 for 'a year'. 
                they try to go to York in 44 but are turned back (marston moor is 2 july 1644; york under siege 11 april-2 july 44) 
                and end up at kirklington and stay with mr daggett. 
                move to hipswell nov 29 1644 [she dates some hipswell events 43 44 but this date suggests 64+]. 
                so when at goes to middleham to help katherine have a baby it was 43/4.

             very slight uncertainty still?
             Shrove Sunday can be (allegedly) either "Septuagesima Sunday" (3rd Sunday before Ash Wednesday") *or* Quinquagesima, Sun before Ash Wed.
                Ians English Calendar (ecclestiastical yr starting 1 Jan)
                1661 - Ash Wed= 27 Feb Quinq... = 24 Feb Septuagesima = *10 Feb*.
                1662 - Ash Wed= 12 Feb *Q = 9 Feb* Sept = 26 Jan.
                
                they were at Oswoldkirk from June 1660
                the next set of dates is the move to E.Newton June 1662.
                so in chronology could be 1661 or 1662
                but mention of pregnancy seems to make it 1662.
