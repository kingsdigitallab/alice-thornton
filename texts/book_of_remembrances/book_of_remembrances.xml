       <!-- NOTES ON DATES:
         
         NB: our main problem is that Alice does not consistently start the year on 1 Jan (NS) or 25 Mar (OS); occasionally we can't work out which year a date between 1 Jan and 24 March is supposed to be in.
         
         following MoEML, three @datingMethod:
         #JulianJan year starts 1 January
         #JulianMar date = 1 Jan-24 Mar and year starts 25 March
         #JulianSic (rare) only used where date = 1 Jan-24 Mar and we don't know which of the two possible years it is
         ***UPDATE: added for Book 3***
         Book 3 contains a number of dates written in the form 1668/9 (=1669). 
         #JulianSlash is used to differentiate from other dates, but the @*-custom attribute is encoded as per JulianJan, eg 1 Jan 1668/9 is encoded as 1669-01-01
         
         ** JulianJan is treated as default datingMethod so not explicitly encoded (at the moment)**
         ** Julian calendar is treated as the default calendar, so not explicitly encoded (atm)** 
         ** using @-custom attributes with -iso style formatting
         
         ** year-only dates are assumed #JulianJan unless clear reason (eg from nearby dates) to do otherwise
         
         <calendar> will need proper description later
         
         Sometimes we know from other sources that Alice has got a date wrong. These are encoded using <choice><sic><corr>

         Q: needs work, uncertain about how to proceed
         
         TODO/Q [teams] - discussion on MS Teams; transcription updates, contractions, convention changes, etc to be completed later
         
         [] comment/note tags give some indication of what it's about
         [endnote] moved from Word endnotes into comment
         
     TO DO/REVIEW:
        
        <pb> need renumbering (will redo them properly as xml:id) but waiting for ST to fix transcriptions first.
        [reminder to self: already checked numbering in this book is consistent even=left, odd=right.]
        once xml:id is done, I'll probably use @n to hold AWT's page numbers including putative [numbers] where she didn't number pages. 
     
        abbrev/contraction issues 
        - needs to be fixed in the transcription first
        - tagging of abbreviations/contractions and markers. maybe some <hi superscript> should be tagged as ex? hmm.
        - NB diff between number<sup> (majority of hi/sup) and word<sup>...
        
        seg @rend=underline (all books)
          final check through remaining <seg>underline in all four books to make sure none of them should be rend(rule) and if any should be converted to emph tags.
          but what should emph be used for? 
             tei: emph = "marks words or phrases which are stressed or emphasized for linguistic or rhetorical effect." example = You took the car and did <emph>what</emph>?!! (and I think all the further examples are the same type of thing) 
             - not sure I've seen any clear examples of Alice using underline for exactly this type of emphasis. 
             - but she does underline things to (afaict) draw attention to them, so does that also count as emph?
             - Cf. most underline in BkRem used on headings and seems most appropriate to treat as decoration. Queried ones are at end of sections and the Q is whether they should be treated as section markers. 
      
        remaining endnotes (<note> @place=end)
          type=word mostly spelling suggestions - where interpretation is straightforward, tag <w norm=""> or <sic>. but keep uncertain ones for later review.
          type=context may become editorial annotations - leave them for now
   
       events tagging - milestone/anchor pairs 
                at present milestone/anchor pairs are linked using @n, prefix "ev". 
                not yet implemented @spanTo or linking event mentions
                milestone/anchor pairs are not always siblings, not always in the same paragraph, not always at same level in tree
                but they *are* always in the same <div> (if an event spans divs I split into two)
                they can be "nested" for sub-events. (though i might not do this) 
                they can overlap. etc.
                
        
      
      tagging of ms description features 
          - a lot of this to be dropped or only described in msDescription, but will review properly after transcription updates autumn 2022.
          related footnotes > comments for reference/to come back to
          i've started teiHeader/msDesc with examples of tags that are likely to be useful, but we might not use all of them in the end.
        

     
      notes on names linkage (at end of Sept '22)
      - most people names are now tagged in all four books 
      - nearly all tagged <persName> are linked to people masterlist db 
      - (additional bk2/3 people bios in progress)
      TODO
      - at least half of people tagged with <rs> (type=person/group) have not yet been linked to the db; I'll review these but some will not be identifiable and they're generally lower priority
      - completion of people.xml standoff to include relationships - to be done once bios have been completed

         Q? what about place for labels?
         
       (TODO?)  link entries to text - done where there is a div, but what about entries with no div to link to...?
            
       recorded alice discrepancies 
       - for now recorded the actual (start) page number in @n in <ref>. not sure if there's a better option. nb the alice number rather than the transcriber number.
       - one or two braced groups where one item has correct page ref and another doesn't, ffs alice. for these, added empty <ref> and n.
       
       [curlybraces] [phew]
         
         https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind2110&L=TEI-L&D=0&P=29205 
          (PS) We never found a
            simple encoding solution that fit every variant use, since
            curly braces can be used in many circumstances to group many
            sorts of things with many sorts of meanings. Most often, we
            asked: 'what sort of thing is the brace grouping and what is the 
            nature of the group itself?' and then attempted to capture 
            *that* rather than the physical presence of the brace itself. 
            If the brace grouped lines, then the resultant group was an <lg>; 
            if it associated lines with a given speaker, then the group was
            a distinct <sp>; if it grouped items in a list, then the group
            was itself a nested <list>. And the text *associated* with that
            group by means of the brace ended up tagged in such a way as
            to associate it with the group in an appropriate way. E.g.,
            as <speaker> or <stage> within the speech, <head> of the 
            nested list or line group, etc.
            summarised:
         https://textcreationpartnership.org/docs/oxdox/encoding/list.html#braces [context = lists]
           https://wwp.northeastern.edu/research/publications/guide/html/rendition_braced.html [context = lines of verse/list]
           
           this might just work... 
           
           **for a braced group of items in a list**
           
           - nested list for the grouped items
           - <label> to indicate the (page ref or item) the brace is pointing *to*
           - @rend on <list> for the look of the bracket itself
           rend="braced()" 
           } [or "right"?]  brace points right 
          {  brace points left - though I don't think there are any in any of the books! can drop the (}) entirely if so, but keep it for now.
          but could also have braced(]) if the brace is square shape? :-S
          
          - @place of brace ?
          *if there are any variations in alignment you'll need to add a place attribute, but for the moment the assumption is that right pointing braces are also placed to the right of the element (and left would be to the left).
          
            <label> also has @place attribute: 
              right/left (in index context they're all right)
              top/mid/bottom [i think NOT centre for valign, to avoid ambiguity] 
              - where top = level with the top line 
              - bottom = level with bottom line 
              - mid  = anywhere in between.
             (labels have been moved to top or bottom of group as necessary)
           
           ** outside lists or list-like things **
           
           in the index braces are also used for *single* items that span more than one line. unlike a list there isn't an obvious tag to hold the braced lines, but I think one is needed to avoid any uncertainty about what text is braced. so i think seg will be ok here. 
 
            <seg rend="braced(})"> for the braced lines
            <label place="right ..."> for the <ref> 
            move the <label> to follow the <seg> if it wasn't originally transcribed there (top/mid)
