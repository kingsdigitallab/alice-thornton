       <!-- NOTES ON DATES:
         
            NB: our main problem is that Alice does not consistently start the year on 1 Jan (NS) or 25 Mar (OS); occasionally we can't work out which year (of the two possible) a date between 1 Jan and 24 March is supposed to be in.
         
         following MoEML, three @datingMethod/@calendar
         #JulianJan year starts 1 January 
         #JulianMar date=1 Jan-24 Mar and year starts 25 March
         #JulianSic (rare) only used where date =1 Jan-24 Mar and we don't know which of the two possible years it is
         ***UPDATE: added for Book 3***
         Book 3 contains a number of dates written in the form 1668/9 (=1669). 
         #JulianSlash to differentiate from other dates, but the @*-custom attribute is encoded as per JulianJan, eg 1 Jan 1668/9 is encoded as 1669-01-01
         
         ** JulianJan is treated as default datingMethod so not explicitly encoded (at the moment)**
         ** Julian calendar is treated as the default calendar, so not explicitly encoded (atm)** 
         ** use @-custom attributes with -iso style formatting
         NB year-only dates are assumed #JulianJan unless clear reason to do otherwise
         
         <calendar> will need proper description later

          Transcriber Notes:
         A few items remain highlighted:
         
            <hi rend="background(lightGray)">grey</hi>
              – on page 1 only. ‘Corrections’ here are all in a later hand. Given our practice elsewhere, these should probably be deleted, but I wondered if this may be of our interest to our symposium speakers (perhaps especially Paul?)
         
            <hi rend="background(magenta)">pink</hi>
             – indicates intentional blank spaces (generally where AT intends to insert a date or a sum of money but doesn’t actually do so).

         
         
         ENCODING NOTES
         
         <pb> @n and Page \d+ in comments = Transcriber page numbers (latter may be removed once i've finished tagging, but are convenient for quick finding)
         (fw type=pageNum are Alice's written numbers; not on every page in this book)
         
     xml comment keywords:
         NOTE: a comment on something, but shouldn't need any further (or very minor, low-priority) action.
         TODO: needs work; I probably know what's needed
         Q: needs work, uncertain about how to proceed
         
         TODO/Q [teams] - discussion on MS Teams; transcription updates, contractions, convention changes, etc to be completed later
         
         [tags] for some indication of what it's about
         [endnote] moved from Word endnotes into comment
         <note> @place=end are Word endnotes; some may be retained as editorial notes but many are likely to be internal comemnts for the project only, which will either be deleted or moved into xml comments
         
          
      notes on names linkage (at end of Sept '22)
      - most people names are now tagged in all four books 
      - nearly all tagged <persName> are linked to people masterlist db 
      - (additional bk2/3 people bios in progress)
      TODO
      - at least half of people tagged with <rs> (type=person/group) have not yet been linked to the db; I'll review these but some will not be identifiable and they're generally lower priority
      - completion of people.xml standoff to include relationships - to be done once bios have been completed

                  'Paper' could plausibly actually be a first attempt at 'Draught' but she runs out of space and so repeats on the second line? As for 'false', there's definitely crosses over those 3rd and 4th letters, so looks more like 'faffe' but that makes no sense? Jury still out here so leaving highlighted! Something like ‘first’ [ferste?] would make sense here but need a better look. She often uses ‘paper books’ in this context of legal docs. Had another look and I can’t see ‘ferste’ but could be ‘faste’. According to OED, ‘faste’ can be something fixed (i.e., made fast) or established (so another way of referring to previous papers?).As still not entirely resolved, I’ve replaced the letters we’re unsure of with ‘[x]’ as per conventions.</p>
