          <h2>Remembrances of a Woman's Life in the Seventeenth Century</h2>
<p>'Alice Thornton's Books' is a collaborative research project
which will enhance understanding of the lives and works of early modern women.</p>
<p>While by no means the only seventeenth-century woman to write her own life story,
Thornton is unusual in having written four different versions of her autobiography.
Collectively, her books offer an extraordinarily rich insight into gentry life
in seventeenth-century Yorkshire, at a time of civil war, plague, and a high infant
mortality rate.</p>
<p><strong>This website will provide resources aimed at better understanding the life and
work of Alice Thornton</strong> and, in due course, will host a fully searchable digital
edition of all four of her autobiographical texts.</p>
<h2>Who Was Alice Thornton?</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/placeholder.jpg#left" alt="Alt text" title="Photograph of kirklington">
Alice was born Alice Wandesford in Kirklington, Yorkshire on 13 February 1626.
She was the fifth child of Alice Osborne Wandesford and Christopher Wandesford.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/placeholder.jpg#right" alt="Alt text" title="image of robert's memorial from Nally">
After her father's death, she married a member of the lesser gentry in North
Yorkshire, William Thornton. They had nine children, but only three were still
alive when William himself died in 1668.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/placeholder.jpg#center" alt="Alt text" title="image of East Newton">
Alice continued to live at East Newton until her own death in 1707.
In her will she left her daughter Nally 'three Books of... my life',
together with all other books written in her own hand.</p>
