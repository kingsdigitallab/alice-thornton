          <h2>About Our Research Project</h2>
<p>This AHRC-funded research project will create an online digital edition of all four of Alice Wandesford Thornton’s autobiographical manuscripts. To date our knowledge of Thornton’s life has largely been dependent on a nineteenth century edition by Charles C. Jackson that selected materials from some of those manuscripts to produce a single, chronological narrative of her life.</p>
<p>By contrast, our edition will make the full text of all four manuscripts freely available for the first time. This will allow users to compare and contrast her versions of events and examine how she revised her story.</p>
<p>In the process of creating this digital edition, we aim to answer three key questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do Thornton’s texts complicate current scholarship on early modern life-writing, particularly its gendered nature?</li>
<li>Why did Thornton write four different autobiographical texts? How do they relate to each other and what might this reveal about their timing, process of composition and audience?</li>
<li>How does Thornton’s engagement with contemporary legal, medical, political, and religious discourses enhance understanding of early modern women in Britain and Ireland?</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Project Team</h2>
<p>‘Alice Thornton’s Books’ brings together historians, literary scholars and digital analysts from the University of Edinburgh and King’s Digital Lab.</p>

<p><strong>Principal Investigator</strong>: Dr Cordelia Beattie is a Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Edinburgh. She has published widely on women in pre-modern England, but with a particular interest in women and the law. While she first taught one of Alice Thornton’s books in 2000, this project stems from her locating two untraced Thornton manuscripts in late 2018 and early 2019. She is particularly interested in what light Thornton’s texts shed on women’s experiences of the law in seventeenth-century England.</p>

<p><strong>Co-Investigator</strong>: Dr Suzanne Trill is a Senior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Edinburgh. From her PhD on women and the Psalms through to her editorial work on Anne, Lady Halkett, Suzanne’s research has focused on early modern women’s writing, primarily devotional poetry and prose (c. 1550-1700).  She also teaches courses on early modern women’s life-writing and textual editing, and is excited to be involved in this project which will reassess Thornton’s literary and historical significance and make her writings available to a much wider range of readers than ever before.</p>

<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong>: Dr Jo Edge specialises in late medieval and early modern European social and cultural history, with an emphasis on medicine and the ‘occult’ sciences: divination, magic and astrology; as well as the experience of illness and death. She cut her digital humanities teeth as Assistant Editor on the Casebooks Project at the University of Cambridge (2014-18). She has also held library and lectureship positions at the University of Manchester. Her first book, <em><strong>Numerological Divination in Late Medieval England</strong></em> is under contract with Boydell and Brewer. She is especially interested in Thornton’s accounts of her own illnesses and descriptions of the deathbed scenes of her close family members.</p>

<p><strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong>: Dr Sharon Howard has research interests in the social history of early modern Britain, especially the history of crime and women’s history. She has published an article on Alice Thornton's use of providential language of danger and deliverance in her descriptions of childbirth. She has extensive experience of project management, research, data creation and encoding for digital history projects including the Old Bailey Online, London Lives 1690-1800 and the Power of Petitioning in 17th-century England. She is intrigued by Thornton's uses of petitionary prayers and narratives that echo seventeenth-century secular petitions.</p>
