<p>Follow the curved grey line that starts with her birth and concludes with her death. The timeline starts from left to right, following the curve downward and round to snake in the opposite direction. Arrows are included at each curve to guide the direction of reading.</p>

<p>Triangles on the timeline represent the number of events in each year that Thornton wrote about. Taller triangles indicate years with more recorded events, while smaller triangles reflect fewer events.  Long vertical lines mark events of historical importance or notable years in Thornton’s own life.</p>

<p>Hovering over each year reveals more details about the events recorded for that year. Clicking/tapping on a year expands additional information.</p>
