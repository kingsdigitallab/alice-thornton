             <p>Below is a visual representation revealing the story of Alice Thornton’s life, using data from her Books and other sources. It shows the many births and almost as many deaths of her children and immediate family members, along with some marriages. Significant historical events are also noted to show their relationship with Thornton’s life.</p>
<p>
"Guidelines" and "Key" section on the right, slide out once triggered, give guidance on how to understand and navigate the timeline.</p>

<em>Note: All elements below scale in response to the viewport so best viewed on a larger screen. </em>

<h2>How to read</h2>
            <p>Follow the curved grey line that starts with her birth and concludes with her death. The timeline starts from top left to right, following the curve downward and round to snake in the opposite direction. Arrows are included at each curve to guide the direction of reading.</p>
<p>Circles on the timeline represent the number of events in each year that Thornton wrote about. Larger circles indicate years with more recorded book events, while smaller circles reflect fewer book events.  Small black diamonds mark events of historical importance or notable years in Thornton’s own life.</p>
<p>Hovering over each year reveals more details about the events recorded for that year. Clicking/tapping on a year expands additional information.</p>
