title: Accessibility Statement for Alice Thornton's Books
---

This statement applies to the Alice Thornton's Books site (https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/).

This website is run by [King's Digital Lab, King's College London (KDL)](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk) in collaboration with the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand..

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## <a id="how"></a>How accessible this website is

We know some part of this website are not fully accessible:

- Dynamic content is handled with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and we are aware that the rendered HTML includes custom tags that don't pass the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). This may interfere with assistive technologies. We are still in the process of assessing the site and plan to ensure all important content, if not all, is accessible.
- 

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

Please email Jo.Edge@ed.ac.uk with details of the problems.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed above and the work in progress still happening on the site.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility
