title: Accessibility Statement for Alice Thornton's Books
---

This statement applies to the Alice Thornton's Books site (https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/).

This website is run by [King's Digital Lab, King's College London (KDL)](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk) in collaboration with the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## <a id="how"></a>How accessible this website is

We know some part of this website are not fully accessible:

- Dynamic content is handled with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and we are aware that the rendered HTML includes custom tags that don't pass the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). This may interfere with assistive technologies. We are still in the process of assessing the site and plan to ensure all important content, if not all, is accessible;
- The editorial formatting on some static pages, blog and news articles is sometime inconsistent. We are aware of missing headings on blog posts and missing alternative description of images in various places. We hope to address these issues before final release early in 2025.
- The book, version and page selectors on the text viewer may cause issues with assistive technologies due to missing labels;
- The mentions of blank or deleted pages, lines or words in the Text Viewer may be difficult to read due to the lack of contrasting color with the background;
- In the Text Viewer some elements are not fully accessible through keyboard navigation alone, and may not work consistently across all browsers, namely:
  - the information box for underlined entries (such as people, place names, and events) in the text are not accessible; - the keyboard outline for the clone button on each panel appears out of sequential order;
  - after clicking on image icon to open modal image window it may not be possible to use keyboard navigation to close that window.
- On the search page, the long list of filters may cause issues with keyboard only users, due to some limitation of the design and layout, it is not possible to bypass the filters to view the search results. Users may find similar issues when they enlarge the page to 200% zoom;
- In the Text Viewer, the clone button is hidden in 200% zooming to avoid overcrowding the screen with too many panes. It may not be working consistently across all browsers;

We hope to address the above listed accessibility issues on the Text Viewer before the final release in early 2025.
