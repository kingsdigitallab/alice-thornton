## About Our Research Project

This AHRC-funded research project (Ref: AH/V012738/1), in partnership with Durham Cathedral, has created an online digital edition of all four of Alice Thornton’s autobiographical Books as its main output. To date, our knowledge of Thornton’s life has largely been dependent on a nineteenth-century edition by Charles C. Jackson that selected materials from some of those manuscript Books to produce a single, chronological narrative of her life.

By contrast, our edition makes the full text of all four manuscripts freely available for the first time. This allows users to compare and contrast her versions of events and examine how she revised her story.

Over the course of this project, we kept in mind three key questions:

1. How do Thornton’s Books complicate current scholarship on early modern life-writing, particularly its gendered nature?
2. Why did Thornton write four different autobiographical Books? How do they relate to each other and what might this reveal about their timing, process of composition and audience?
3. How does Thornton’s engagement with contemporary legal, medical, political, and religious discourses enhance understanding of early modern women in Britain and Ireland?
