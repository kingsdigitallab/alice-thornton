## Description

Small autograph manuscript volume (H133mm x W96mm x D13mm) with the title ‘A Book of Remembrances of All the Remarkable Deliverances of Myself, Husband and Children, with their Births and Other Remarks as Concerning Myself and Family, Beginning from the Year 1625’ (page 1). It has a marbled paper cover, which is sewn into larger boards which were originally also covered in marbled paper; the larger boards have endpapers. There are multiple areas of sewing, some of which may have been added at later dates, perhaps including the final and penultimate entries where the pages are smaller than the rest of the volume (pages 195-200). The volume also includes a five page ‘index’ (pages 177-85) and extends to 200 pages in total.

## Provenance

Owned by Thomas Comber, of Newton-le-Willows (1875); Rev. Mr Edward F. Comber, Wrenbury, Cheshire (1936); Philip Comber, Ludlow (2018); and given to DCL (2019). A microfilm copy is held by [Yale University Library](https://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/615720).

## Dating

Anselment notes that this volume cannot ‘be dated with any certainty’.[^1] Although the *Book* opens by recording Thornton’s date of birth (page 3) and the first entry is dated 1631 (page 11), the length and detail of the entries increase from 1659 and there is a reference to being called on to give testimony by Lord Danby in the backmatter, which occurred c.1673. Other annotations suggest that Thornton revised her entries. On this basis, we conjecture that the majority of this *Book* was composed between 1659-68.
