## Description 

Full leather-bound manuscript (H155mm x W100 x D30mm) with paper label on the spine.[^1] The leather is quite worn. Thornton’s text extends to 293 pages (around 62,000-words) but a later owner, her great, great grandson Thomas Comber (1765–1835), added some additional content between 1800–27. The Book has no title page and does not contain an index but uses 44 headings to divide up the text. 

## Provenance 

Owned by Thornton’s great, great grandson, Thomas Comber of Creech St Michael, Somerset (1800); Rev. Henry George Wandesford Comber, MA, Rector of Oswaldkirk (1875). Given to Durham Cathedral Library by A.G. Hickson (1969) and identified by Cordelia Beattie (2019). 

## Dating

_Book 2_ covers material no later than the first year of her widowhood (1668-9) but internal evidence points to a later dating of c.1685-95. There is a reference to her brother Christopher’s grandchildren (he had two by c.1685) on [page 105](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&p0.lo=p.105&p0.vi=modern), which gives our earliest date. Thornton also notes that most of the people who spread rumours about her in 1668 were now dead which was perhaps the case by 1691 and most likely the case by 1695 ([page 292](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&p0.lo=p.292&p0.vi=modern)). It is referenced in _Book 3_ (pages [82](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&p0.lo=p.82&p0.vi=modern), [99](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&p0.lo=p.99&p0.vi=modern), [132](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&p0.lo=p.132&p0.vi=modern)), which indicates it was written first and therefore finished by c.1695.
