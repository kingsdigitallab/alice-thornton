## Description (Coming soon)

## Provenance (Coming soon)

## Dating

_Book 3_ covers material no later than the first year of her widowhood (1668-9) but internal evidence points to a later dating of c.1692-6. In the text Thornton refers to the fact that her only son to live to adulthood had died, an event which happened on 5 June 1692 (page 152). There is also a marginal comment on page 31, noting that it had been 52 years since the Battle of Marston Moor (1644), which gives a date of 1696.
