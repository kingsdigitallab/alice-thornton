## Description 

Autograph manuscript volume (210mm x 165mm x 40mm), a quarto notebook with original calf binding and gilt stamped. On the opening page is Thornton’s monogram and the date of her husband’s death but no title is given. The text runs to 217 pages (approximately 85,000-words), with 138 ruled but otherwise blank pages at the back of the book. 

## Provenance 

Owned by Thornton’s grandson, Thomas Comber (c.1721-65); the Rev. Henry George Wandesford Comber, MA, Rector of Oswaldkirk (1875). Sold at Sotheby's, 13 December 1994, lot 44, to Quaritch. Then owned by Paula Peyraud, New York State. Sold at Bloomsbury Auctions, New York, 6 May 2009, lot 464, to the British Library. 

## Dating

_Book 3_ covers material no later than the first year of her widowhood (1668-9) but internal evidence points to a later dating of c.1692-6. In the text Thornton refers to the fact that her only son to live to adulthood had died, an event which happened on 5 June 1692 (page 152). There is also a marginal comment on page 31, noting that it had been 52 years since the Battle of Marston Moor (1644), which gives a date of 1696.
