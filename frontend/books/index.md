## Digital Edition

Over the course of the project (2021-25), this project will publish an interactive and fully searchable digital edition of Alice Thornton’s autobiographical Books which will be freely accessible here.

The text of all four manuscripts will be available to read in both fully modernised and semi-diplomatic versions, either separately or side-by-side. As we are using the widely recognised Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup schema, the edition will be fully searchable (for example, users will be able to trace people, places and events across all four Books).

<div class="bookshelf">
  {%- assign books = collections.books | sort:"data.bookOrder" -%}
  {%- for abook in books -%}
    {% if abook.url != page.url %}
      <figure class="book columns">
        <a href="{{ abook.url | url }}" class="column is-half">
          <img src="{{ abook.data.image }}" alt="Photograph of the original front of book, very used scuffed faded covers, showcasing charm and elegance">
        </a>
        <div class="column is-half is-flex is-flex-direction-column">
          <h3>{{ abook.data.title }}</h3>
          <figcaption>
            {{ abook.data.holdingArchive }},<br>
            {{ abook.data.itemLocation }}
          </figcaption>
          <div class="book-buttons">
          {% if abook.data.isReadable %}<a href="viewer/?p0.do={{ abook.fileSlug }}&p0.vi=modern" class="button is-primary">Read the edition</a>{% endif %}<br>
            <a href="{{ abook.url | url }}" class="button is-secondary">Book information</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </figure>
    {% endif %}
  {%- endfor -%}
</div>

Although we are not digitising the manuscripts, we will provide some sample images from each of them to offer a sense of how the original materials look.

You can now access our [partial release](/books/viewer/?p0.vi=modern), in both semi-diplomatic and modernised versions. See also our second release of the [search function](/entities/).

Feedback is especially welcome as we work towards our final release in February 2025; see the icon on the bottom right.


## Background

When Alice Thornton died in 1707, she bequeathed ‘three Books of my own Meditations and Transactions of my life, and all the residue of my Papers and Books written with my own hand’ to her daughter, Alice Thornton Comber. In addition to those three manuscript books, there exists another, smaller manuscript known as her _Book of Remembrances_.

In the introduction to his nineteenth-century edition, Charles C. Jackson refers to all four manuscripts; after this, however, the location of the manuscript books was unclear for many years.

In 1982 and 1994, two manuscripts re-emerged and were sold to a private buyer, Paula Peyraud. These manuscript books were resold in 2009 and are now held at the British Library (BL).

In 2018 and 2019, Cordelia Beattie located the other two manuscripts: one was still in the hands of the Comber family and the other had been in the possession of Durham Cathedral Library (DCL) since 1969 but had been misidentified in the catalogue. Today, both manuscript books form part of the [Comber Collection](https://n2t.durham.ac.uk/ark:/32150/s2hm50tr76x.xml) at DCL.

These are the four Books that we are in the process of preparing for our digital edition.

It has become common to refer to Thornton’s Books as the _Book of Remembrances_ (DCL, GB-0033-CCOM 38), _Book 1_ (BL, Add. MS 88897/1), _Book 2_ (DCL, GB-0033-CCOM 7), and _Book 3_ (BL, Add. MS 88897/2). However, material evidence suggests that the relationship between Thornton’s Books is not straightforwardly sequential. A key issue this project seeks to address is why and how these Books are interconnected.

Our editorial and markup practice aims to make this possible. We prefer the following fuller titles, which use descriptions derived from her writings:

- _Book of Remembrances_
- _Book 1: The First Book of My Life_
- _Book 2: The First Book of My Widowed Condition_
- _Book 3: The Second Book of My Widowed Condition_

However, for ease of reference, we will also use abbreviated titles:

- _Book Rem_
- _Book 1_
- _Book 2_
- _Book 3_
