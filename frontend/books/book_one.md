## Description (Coming soon)

## Provenance (Coming soon)

## Dating

Evidence from _Book 3_ suggests that she had enough of her ‘book of my life’ to circulate in late 1668 (page 196); Thornton also notes that she was writing in that book, about her widowhood, in March 1669 (page 179). If the ‘scandal’ was a key prompt for the writing of _Book 1_, then a dating of c.1668-9 works for the majority of the volume. Some of the back matter was clearly added later, though, as Thornton notes the death of her brother, Christopher, in 1687 (page 292).
