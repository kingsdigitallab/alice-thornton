## Transcription Process

Although all of _Book 2_ had been transcribed from the original
manuscript by Dr Lisa Liddy before the AHRC project began, as Covid-19
protocols were still in place in its early stages, the initial
transcriptions of the other books were predominantly made from digital
images. Patrick Comber gave permission for Cordelia Beattie to photograph the *Book of Remembrances*,
while the British Library supplied images of *Book 1* and *Book 3*.
Durham Cathedral Library produced images of *Book 2* which allowed
us to cross check transcriptions remotely. Team members noted queries
that required checking in the original manuscripts which were updated
when it became possible to do so. In order to ensure these provided a
firm foundation for future work, the first set of transcriptions were
fully diplomatic in format and were saved as word documents for future
reference.

Workflow has ensured that several different project team members have
been involved in the transcription process.

- first transcription: fully diplomatic

  - transcribed by two members of the team

  - cross-checked by transcribers

  - checked by another team member

- second transcription: semi-diplomatic

  - transcribed by two members of the team

  - cross-checked by transcribers

  - checked by another team member

  - shared with the Project Board and the contributors to the volume
    of essays commissioned to accompany the Digital Scholarly
    Edition (DSE).

## Editorial Principles

### Semi-Diplomatic

The semi-diplomatic version of the text retains some original textual
features, including original lineation, paragraphing, punctuation and
capitalisation. It also includes evidence of authorial corrections, such
as insertions and deletions, and records spaces left intext and blank
pages. Further details on how these features are recorded in our DSE can
be found below.

However, we have silently modernised Thornton's use of u/v, i/j and long
S, and expanded her contractions of common words such as 'the', 'which',
and 'that' (from 'y^e'^, 'w^ch'^ and' y^t'^), alongside her more unusual
use of 'o.^r^' for 'our'. We have not retained end of line fillers (e.g.
\~) and variant forms of hyphenation have been standardised to '-'.

Thornton's hand is predominantly italic and mostly highly legible;
however, this is not always the case \[see images?\] and, especially
where her hand is less legible, Thornton makes frequent use of
idiosyncratic abbreviations in which vowels are omitted. Two features of
Thornton's orthography we were unable to record that may be of interest
to historical linguists are her use of 'i' for 'c' and her frequent use
of 'hn' for 'him'.

### Modernisation

This modernised version of the text follows the conventions of UK
English, supplemented by Chicago Manual of Style (CMS, 17)
recommendations. However, to retain a sense of Thornton's distinctive
voice, we have retained some archaic forms for which we have provided
glosses. Sometimes Thornton's syntax deviates from modern expectations
and where further intervention is required to clarify sense supplied
materials are identified by square brackets; to retain a clean reading
experience in this modernised edition of her Books, these are displayed
in the SD version.

As is common in Early Modern English (EME), Thornton's sentences
frequently commence with a conjunction (most often, 'and', 'but' or
'which').


### Structural Divisions

The four texts share a [standard basic TEI
structure](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DS.html):
**\<teiHeader\>** (metadata) and **\<text\>** (the transcription of the
text), with an additional **\<standOff\>** container for editorial
notes. Within **\<text\>**, all four of the texts contain a main
**\<body\>** and some kind of **\<front\>** matter. Two of the books
also contain **\<back\>** matter.
