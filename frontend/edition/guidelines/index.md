## Transcription Process

Although \[most of\] Book 2 had been transcribed from the original
manuscript by Lisa L\[xxx\] before the project began, as Covid-19
protocols were still in place in its early stages, the initial
transcriptions of the other books were predominantly made from
high-quality colour digital images. In order to ensure these provided a
firm foundation for future work, this first set of transcriptions were
fully diplomatic and saved as word documents for future reference.

Workflow has ensured that several different project team members have
been involved in the transcription process.

-   first transcription: fully diplomatic

    -   transcribed by two members of the team

    -   cross-checked by transcribers

    -   checked by another team member

Team members noted queries that required checking in the original
manuscripts which were updated when it became possible to do so.
