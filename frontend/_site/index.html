          <h2>Remembrances of a Woman's Life in the Seventeenth Century</h2>
          <p>
            'Alice Thornton's Books' is a collaborative research project<br />
            which will enhance understanding of the lives and works of early
            modern women.
          </p>
          <p>
            While by no means the only seventeenth-century woman to write her
            own life story,<br />
            Thornton is unusual in having written four different versions of her
            autobiography.<br />
            Collectively, her books offer an extraordinarily rich insight into
            gentry life<br />
            in seventeenth-century Yorkshire, at a time of civil war, plague,
            and a high infant<br />
            mortality rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will provide resources aimed at better understanding
            the life and<br />
            work of Alice Thornton and, in due course, will host a fully
            searchable digital<br />
            edition of all four of her autobiographical texts.
          </p>
          <h2>Who Was Alice Thornton?</h2>

          </p>
          <p>
            Most of what we know about Alice Thornton (1626-1707) is drawn from
            the autobiographical accounts which she left to her eldest daughter
            in her will. She relates a veritable ‘riches to rags’ story,
            punctuated by many of what she presents as near-death experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in Kirklington, Yorkshire on 13 February 1626, Alice spent her
            childhood years in relative comfort in Yorkshire, London and Dublin.
            She was the fifth child and youngest daughter of Christopher
            Wandesford (1592-1640) and his wife Alice Osborne (1593-1659). She
            later writes that she had her first deliverance from death at age
            three at Kirklington Hall when she was following her nurse, Sara,
            and tripped on a hearth stone and cut her head open.

          </p>
          <p>
            In 1633, the family relocated to Ireland, as her father's friend and
            mentor, Thomas Wentworth (first Lord Strafford), had been made Lord
            Deputy of Ireland and there was a role for Christopher Wandesford in
            Dublin. Here, Alice spent time with Ladies Anne and Arabella
            Wentworth and learnt French, singing, dancing, silk-work and other
            ‘suitable’ accomplishments. Their playtime together included a
            swinging game that caused another near-death experience. In early
            1640, her father took over as Lord Deputy of Ireland before his
            sudden death later that year at just 48 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            After her father’s death, and prompted by the turmoil of the Irish
            Rebellion, the family move back to the north of England. However,
            the following year they are caught up in the events of the civil
            war. Alice's family were for the king and their estates at
            Kirklington were confiscated and Scottish soldiers were billeted on
            her mother’s lands in Hipswell, Richmondshire.
          </p>
          <p>
            When her oldest brother, George, drowned in the river Swale in 1651
            – which Alice claims to have foretold in a dream six months earlier
            – she reluctantly agreed to marry. Her family settle on William
            Thornton (1624-1668), a member of the lesser gentry in Ryedale,
            whose parliamentarian family connections could help the Wandesfords
            recover their lands.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice and William were married for seventeen years and during that
            time she gave birth to nine children. Alice vividly describes the
            dangers of childbirth and poignantly records the deaths of six of
            her infant children. She charts the development of those who survive
            - Alice (Nally), Katherine and Robert - and continually thanks God
            for their miraculous deliverances from illnesses and accidents.
            Family finances were frequently precarious and William died in 1668
            without a will and much in debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="/assets/img/home/william-thornton-memorial-cb.jpg#right"
              alt="Alt text"
              title="Memorial for William by Alice"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice then spent her widowed years dealing with the ramifications of
            this while trying to raise her three children. The oldest, Nally,
            was married to the local minister, Thomas Comber, not long after
            William’s death. Alice herself had already been the subject of
            gossip about her close relationship to Thomas and this sudden
            marriage - when Nally was just fourteen - caused further scandal.
            Katherine married in 1682 and Robert was intended for a career in
            the church but he died in 1692.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alice continued to live at East Newton Hall in Ryedale until her own
            death in 1707 but in the final years the property was owned by her
            son-in-law, Thomas Comber, who provided her with an annual pension
            on which to subsist.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her will, Alice made bequests to improve her local church,
            Stonegrave Minster, which her estate could not afford; so, perhaps
            her most important gift was that of her own writings, which stayed
            in Comber family hands for hundreds of years before their
            acquisition by the British Library and Durham Cathedral.
