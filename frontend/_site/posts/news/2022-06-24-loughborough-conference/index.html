            Cordelia Beattie (PI), Suzanne Trill (Co-I) and Sharon Howard (PDRA)
            will be speaking at 'How to do things with early modern words' at
            the University of Loughborough on 15 July 2022.
          </p>

            2021 saw the publication of the first volume of
            <em>The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Aphra Behn</em>. Editing
            Behn’s remarkable oeuvre has involved an international team of
            scholars, drawing on expertise from across the humanities. ‘How to
            do things with early modern words’ marks the 350th anniversary of
            the start of Behn’s career, and aims to celebrate and develop
            interdisciplinary approaches to early modern studies. Bringing
            together researchers working in literature, digital humanities,
            history, theatre history, and language in the 1500-1750 period, the
            conference will explore cutting-edge themes, perspectives and
            approaches in scholarship on the early modern world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will speak on our progress to date towards a digital edition of
            the four manuscript books of Alice Thornton. At this point in the
            project, we are focusing on why Thornton wrote four different
            autobiographical volumes and how they relate to each other. It is
            already clear that their contents raise questions about both the
            composition process and their intended audiences. To begin the
            process of addressing these questions, we have transcribed all four
            manuscripts, and begun the process of editing them and tagging them
            so that users could read them continuously as single volumes,
            side-by-side in semi-diplomatic transcription and modernised form,
            and/or compare variant accounts of the same events. Our panel will
            explore the practical and technical issues involved in the project
            and invite feedback from potential users of the digital edition.
