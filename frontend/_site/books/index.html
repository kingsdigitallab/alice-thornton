          <h2>Digital Edition</h2>
          <p>
            Over the course of the next two years (July 2022-August 2024), this
            project will produce an interactive and fully searchable digital
            edition of Alice Thornton’s autobiographical ‘Books’ which will be
            freely accessible here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The text of all four manuscript volumes will be available to read in
            both fully modernised and semi-diplomatic versions, either
            separately or side-by-side. As we are using the widely recognised
            Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup schema, the edition will be
            fully searchable (for example, users will be able to trace people
            and events across all four volumes).
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we are not digitising the manuscripts, we will provide some
            sample images from each of the volumes to offer a sense of how the
            original materials looked
          </p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            When Alice Thornton died in 1707, she bequeathed ‘three Books of my
            own Meditations and Transactions of my life, and all the residue of
            my Papers and Books written with my own hand’ to her daughter, Alice
            Thornton Comber. In addition to those three Books, there exists
            another, smaller volume known as a <em>Book of Remembrances</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the introduction to his nineteenth-century edition, Charles C.
            Jackson refers to all four volumes; after this, however, the
            location of the manuscripts was unclear for many years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1982 and 1994, two volumes re-emerged and were sold to a private
            buyer, Paula Peyraud. These volumes were resold in 2009 and are now
            held at the British Library (BL).

          <p>
            In 2018/19, Cordelia Beattie located the other two manuscripts: one
            was still in the hands of the Comber family and the other had been
            in the possession of Durham Cathedral Library (DCL) since 1969 but
            had been misidentified in the catalogue. Today, both volumes form
            part of the Comber Collection at DCL.

            These are the four books that we are in the process of preparing for
            our digital edition.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has become common to refer to Thornton’s volumes as the
            <em>Book of Remembrances</em>, <em>Book 1</em>, <em>Book 2</em>, and
            <em>Book 3</em>. However, material evidence suggests that the
            relationship between Thornton’s Books is not straightforwardly
            sequential. A key issue this project seeks to address is why and how
            these volumes are interconnected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our editorial and markup practice aims to make this possible. We
            prefer the following fuller titles, which add descriptions derived
            from her writings:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Book of Remembrances</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 1: The First Book of My Life</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 2: The First Book of My Widowed Condition</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 3: The Second Book of My Widowed Condition</em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, for ease of reference, we will also use abbreviated titles:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Book Rem</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 1</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 2</em></li>
            <li><em>Book 3</em></li>
          </ul>
