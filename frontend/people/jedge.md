Dr Jo Edge specialises in late medieval and early modern European social and cultural history, with an emphasis on medicine and the ‘occult’ sciences: divination, magic and astrology; as well as the experience of illness and death. She cut her digital humanities teeth as Assistant Editor on the [Casebooks Project](https://casebooks.lib.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge (2014-18). She has also held library and lectureship positions at the University of Manchester. Her first book, _Onomantic Divination in Late Medieval Britain: Questioning Life, Predicting Death_ was published by York Medieval Press in 2024. She is especially interested in Thornton’s accounts of the illnesses of both herself and others and what these tell us about her understanding of health and the body in the context of early modern medical discourse. After finishing her role on Thornton's Books, she became an Associate Lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London and Senior Research Associate at the University of Portsmouth.
