Dr Sharon Howard has research interests in the social history of early modern Britain, especially the history of crime and women’s history. She has published an article on Alice Thornton's use of providential language of danger and deliverance in her descriptions of childbirth. She has extensive experience of project management, research, data creation and encoding for digital history projects including the Old Bailey Online, London Lives 1690-1800 and the Power of Petitioning in 17th-century England. She is intrigued by Thornton's uses of petitionary prayers and narratives that echo seventeenth-century secular petitions.
