Dr Suzanne Trill is a Senior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Edinburgh. From her PhD on women and the Psalms through to her editorial work on Anne, Lady Halkett, Suzanne’s research has focused on early modern women’s writing, primarily devotional poetry and prose (c. 1550-1700). She also teaches courses on early modern women’s life-writing and textual editing, and is excited to be involved in this project which will reassess Thornton’s literary and historical significance and make her writings available to a much wider range of readers than ever before.
