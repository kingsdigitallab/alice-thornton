Cordelia Beattie is Professor of Women's and Gender History at the University of Edinburgh. She has published widely on women in pre-modern England, but with a particular interest in women and the law. While she first taught one of Alice Thornton’s books in 2000, this project stems from her locating two previously untraced Thornton manuscripts in late 2018 and early 2019. She is particularly interested in what light Thornton’s texts shed on women’s experiences of the law in seventeenth-century England.
