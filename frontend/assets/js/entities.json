He became Bishop of Derry, in Ireland, in May 1634, and was present at Wandesford's deathbed in December 1640 and was named as one of the executors of his will. After the Irish rebellion of 1641 he was exiled and had returned to his native Yorkshire by 1642. He was restored to Ireland by Charles II in 1660. He died on 25 June 1663.",

When the First Civil War ended, Brereton gave up his local offices and, although nominated as a judge, refused to attend the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He was elected to the Council of State in 1652 and 1653 but did not attend frequently, living in semi-retirement in London. He resumed his seat for Cheshire when the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659, until its dissolution in March 1660, and died on 7 April 1661.",

A barrister at the Middle Temple, he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 14 March 1625. He married Elizabeth, the daughter or widow of John Pierson of Mowthorpe on 14 August 1666 at Nunburnholme, but had no children. He was a royalist captain during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and was godfather to Alice Thornton's eighth child and youngest daughter, Joyce, in September 1665. He died around 1680, when his will was witnessed.]",

Before 1654, she married another servant of Alice Wandesford’s, George Lightfoot, and the couple had at least one child, a daughter. Daphne prayed with Lady Wandesford at her bedside in 1659, and she and her husband were witnesses to her will, in which they were left 20 shillings each. Daphne is described as wet-nursing Thornton’s daughter, Elizabeth, in 1655 while the family were living at Hipswell Hall. She provided a great deal of support to Thornton in the wake of her husband's death in September 1668 but by this date the Lightfoots lived elsewhere, probably near Richmond. She was present with her daughter, Mary, at the private wedding of Thomas and Alice Comber on 17 November 1668. They might still have been working for the family in 1682 when George is mentioned in a letter from Thomas Comber to Thornton. She was buried on 20 September 1689 at St Agatha’s, Gilling West.",

In 1653 and later in 1656 Nettleton was in dispute with Thornton's uncle William Wandesford. William Thornton inherited this debt when he took over the role of administering Wandesford's will from Maulger Norton from at least 1661, when Nettleton sent bailiffs to the Thornton residence.

He became his father's heir in 1638 when his older brother was killed in an accident. His family property was sequestered after the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and Osborne was exiled to Europe in the early 1650s. He married Bridget Bertie and they had 11 children (three sons and eight daughters). He became High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1661 and Lord Treasurer 1673-79. In June 1674 he was made Earl of Danby. Impeached after the 'Popish Plot' in 1678, he spent the next six years in the Tower of London. He was then released on bail and played a key role in the plot against James II, advising William of Orange, who, on becoming king in 1688, made him President of the Privy Council. He was made Marquess of Carmarthen in April 1689. His cousin, Alice Thornton, wrote to him at least three times asking for his help: when he was Lord Treasurer in 1673 about a dispute between Osborne and her brother Christopher; in July 1689, thanking him with helping her son Robert to gain preferment; and in September 1689, seeking preferment for her son-in-law, Thomas Comber. He was made Duke of Leeds in May 1694, but the next year was involved in a corruption scandal and left the political arena. He died on 26 July 1712 at his daughter Sophia’s house in Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. He was buried at All Hallows’, Harthill.]",

He married twice: first Clara van der Eycken of Flanders, with whom he had two sons, before her death in 1621; second, Marguerite of Namur with whom he probably had two more children, although these could have also been with his first wife. He frequently returned to Ireland in the 1640s and was appointed commander of the army of Leinster in 1642. He was made Viscount Tara and Governor of Waterford in 1650.

She married Thomas Purchas, rector, by arrangement of her brother-in-law, Thomas Comber, on 27 December 1682. She had five children by Purchas (three sons and two daughters). After Purchas's death in April 1697, she married Robert Danby of Northallerton in 1698, without her mother’s approval. She died on 17 December 1726 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Stonegrave.",

He became a lecturer at St Clement Danes without Temple Bar in 1587. Suffering with poor health, he died on 4 July 1591 and was buried at Husbands Bosworth. While he has been described as the most popular Puritan preacher of the Elizabethan era, Smith had little time for separatist ideas and his avoidance of controversial theological issues made his sermons very popular. Over twenty editions of his collected sermons were published between 1592 and 1675.",

He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in April 1680, before moving to University College, Oxford in May 1682. In 1687 he became the rector of Oddington, Gloucestershire but resigned it later that year. By 1688 he was in considerable debt and in 1689 he was working as a cleric on a naval ship. In 1691 he was offered a living in Northamptonshire but swapped it for that of Boldon, diocese of Durham, and resided at the Deanery in Durham with his sister, Alice, and her husband, Thomas Comber. In 1692 Comber helped arrange a marriage for him, to a woman worth £2800, but he fell ill and died on 4 June 1692, aged 29, and was buried in the Chapel of the Nine Altars, Durham Cathedral.]",

He married the twice-widowed Elizabeth Denton (née Oglethorpe). In 1645 he was elected 'recruiter' MP (filling a vacancy caused by a by-election) for Richmond. During the second English Civil War he played an important role organising Parliamentary forces in the North and was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1648. While named commissioner to try the king in January 1649 he took no part in it. Later in 1649 he was appointed to ride the northern circuit. On 1 June that year he was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Beverley in 1654 but was prevented from sitting due to refusing to try fellow Yorkshiremen after Penruddock's rising. He took up his seat in 1659 and was reinstated as Baron of the Exchequer in 1660. He was buried at All Hallows’, Bardsey on 7 June 1665.]",
