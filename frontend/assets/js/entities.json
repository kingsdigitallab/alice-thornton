Anne also mentions being related to Lady Berkeley (Frances Culpeper Berkeley), wife to three colonial governors of Virginia. While in Virginia, c.1652, Anne married Christopher Danby, son of Katherine and Thomas Danby, becoming Alice Thornton's niece. Christopher's father did not approve of the match. Her first child born in Virginia in 1653 died straight after the birth. The couple relocated to Yorkshire and lived with Christopher's older brother, Thomas Danby, at Farnley Hall and had five more children, three sons and two daughters. It seems that Anne and her family lived with the Thorntons at East Newton at least twice in the 1660s: firstly in 1661 or 1662 for three months and later, after the death of Thomas Danby, in 1667, when she was cast out by Thomas’s widow, Margaret. In 1668, she was allegedly the source of rumours about Thomas Comber and the Thornton women, resulting in her being evicted from the Thornton household by William.

He was then released on bail and played a key role in the plot against James II, advising William of Orange, who, on becoming king, made him President of the Privy Council. His cousin, Alice Thornton, wrote to him at least three times asking for his help: when he was Lord Treasurer in 1673 for assistance with arbitrating a dispute between herself and her brother, Christopher; in July 1689, seeking preferment for her son Robert; and in September 1689, seeking preferment for her son-in-law, Thomas Comber.

He married the twice-widowed Elizabeth Denton (née Oglethorpe). In 1645 he was elected 'recruiter' MP (i.e. filling a vacancy caused by a by-election) for Richmond. During the second English Civil War he played an important role organising Parliamentary forces in the North and was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1648. While named commissioner to try the king in January 1649 he took no part in it. Later in 1649 he was appointed to ride the northern circuit. On 1 June that year he was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Beverley in 1654 but was prevented from sitting due to refusing to try fellow Yorkshiremen after Penruddock's rising. He took up his seat in 1659 and was reinstated as Baron of the Exchequer in 1660. He was buried at Bardsey Church on 7 June 1665.]",

His brother, Christopher, sent him to be an apprentice to a London merchant. He was granted an annuity of £20 for life on 30 June 1637 out of Wandesford property at Castlecomer, Ireland, paid yearly at Christ's Church, Dublin. He suffered severe losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms due to his loyalty to the royal cause. On 31 July 1646 he declared he had been at Oxford when Castlecomer was held for the king and that he lent money but had not taken up arms. According to Thornton, a committee who advised Charles I during his trial met in his London home. He was made a gentleman-pensioner by Charles II after the Restoration in 1660 and died in 1690.]",
