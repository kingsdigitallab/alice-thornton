She lived at Oakwell Hall, Batley until c.1649 when the family moved to Charles County, Virginia; her father was part of a business venture with Thomas Danby (d.1660) to transport settlers to the area. It was in Virginia that she became friends with Anne Danby. In 1665 she is named in a patent giving her brothers, Thomas and Henry, permission to transport her and 117 others into Charles City County, Virginia. By 1667 she was back in Yorkshire in the service of Anne Savile, Countess of Sussex, at Howley Hall. We do not know when she died but a transfer of property rights in Buckroe, Virginia from herself and her brother, William, suggests she was still alive and unmarried in 1671.",

When the First Civil War ended, Brereton gave up his local offices and, although nominated as a judge, refused to attend the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He was elected to the Council of State in 1652 and 1653 but did not attend frequently, living in semi-retirement in London. He resumed his seat for Cheshire when the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659, until its dissolution in March 1660, and died on 7 April 1661.",

He married an unknown English woman and had a son and a daughter. He is best known for reporting the plot of his foster brother Hugh Og Macmahon to seize Dublin castle on 22 October 1641 to Sir William Parsons, one of the Lords Justices of Ireland, for which he was awarded £500 and a £200 annual pension by the English parliament. He remained in Clotworthy’s service during the 1640s, as well as acting as a messenger for parliament. He became lieutenant colonel commanding Clotworthy’s regiment in 1646, and was shot in a skirmish with the soldiers of Col. John Hamilton in August 1649 at Dunadry, co. Antrim. He died of his wounds and was buried at Antrim.]",

Their first child, born in Virginia, died straight after birth. They moved back to Yorkshire and had five children (three sons and two daughters). On his older brother’s death in 1667, he became heir to his father's estate but granted it to his son, Abstrupus, in the same year, as he was thought incapable of running it. He was sent to the Channel Islands as a soldier sometime in the late 1660s or early 1670s. He was in London for some time in the early 1670s. In 1683 he was involved in legal action with his sister-in-law, Margaret Danby and, in the 1680s, he was in close contact with Thornton in the 1680s. He was buried on 25 November 1689 at St Mary’s, Masham.",

Dodsworth witnessed Alice and William Thornton’s marriage in December 1651, and was buried at St Mary’s, Thornton Watlass on 20 June 1670.",

Thornton refers to him negatively as ‘that Jew’. If the same man, he was involved in drawing up the articles of surrender for the city of York in summer 1644. He became a considerable landowner at Worsborough but, as a royalist, was sequestered, buying back his lands for £350. He had at least one son. His will was dated 7 October 1662 and he died on 9 January 1663. He was buried at St Mary’s, Worsborough.",

Ordained priest in February 1624, he was vicar of St John Baptist, Hunsingore 1623-5 and then rector of Holy Trinity, Stonegrave 1629-44. He was possibly the Nathaniel Jackson who briefly held the rectorship of St Cuthbert’s, Halsall, Lancashire, after the expulsion of royalist Peter Travers in 1645. A puritan, he was rector of All Saints’, Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire, 1647-60, but was deprived on the restoration. Before 1648 he married Anne (birth surname unknown) and they had a son and a daughter. It seems he may have again held the rectorship of Holy Trinity, Stonegrave between 1660-2 before he died. He was buried at York on 1 November 1662. His will left money to John Denton, Thornton’s brother-in-law, and William Thornton was named as a distributor of alms to the poor of Stonegrave parish.]",

A barrister at the Middle Temple, he was admitted to Gray's Inn on 14 March 1625. He was a royalist captain during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and was godfather to Thornton's eighth child, Joyce, in September 1665. He married Elizabeth, the widow (or, less likely, the daughter) of John Pierson of Mowthorpe, on 14 August 1666 at Nunburnholme (East Riding). They had no children. He died around 1680, when his will was witnessed.",

      "bio": "Robert Nettleton, the eldest son of Thomas and Mary Nettleton of Thornhill, Yorks., was born in 1601. He was educated at Gray’s Inn (1619) and gained his Oxford BA in 1621 and MA in 1623. He married Frances Rawlinson and they had nine children (six daughters and three sons). He arrived in Ireland with his younger brother, George, c.1633 and was elected MP for Lifford in 1639, returning to Yorkshire in the early 1640s. In 1652 he inherited a debt from his sister whose late husband had lent Christopher Wandesford £500 pre-1640. William Thornton became a target when he took over the role of administering Wandesford's will c.1661. Nettleton died in 1673 after falling from a horse and was buried on 3 July at St Michael and All Angels’, Thornhill.",

His family property was sequestered after the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and Osborne was exiled to Europe in the early 1650s. He married Bridget Bertie and they had 11 children (three sons and eight daughters). He became High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1661 and Lord Treasurer 1673-79. In June 1674 he was made Earl of Danby. Impeached after the 'Popish Plot' in 1678, he spent the next six years in the Tower of London. He was then released on bail and played a key role in the plot against James II, advising William of Orange, who, on becoming king in 1688, made him President of the Privy Council. He was made Marquess of Carmarthen in April 1689. His cousin, Thornton, wrote to him at least three times asking for his help: when he was Lord Treasurer in 1673 about a dispute between Osborne and her brother Christopher; in July 1689, thanking him with helping her son Robert to gain preferment; and in September 1689, seeking preferment for her son-in-law, Thomas Comber. He was made Duke of Leeds in May 1694, but the next year was involved in a corruption scandal and left the political arena. He died on 26 July 1712 at his daughter Sophia’s house in Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. He was buried at All Hallows’, Harthill.]",

He married twice: first Clara van der Eycken of Flanders, with whom he had two sons, before her death in 1621; second, Marguerite of Namur with whom he probably had two more children, although these could have also been with his first wife. He frequently returned to Ireland in the 1640s and was appointed commander of the army of Leinster in 1642. He was made Viscount Tara and Governor of Waterford in 1650. He returned to Flanders and died there on 21 October 1655.]",

She married Thomas Purchas, rector, by arrangement of her brother-in-law, Thomas Comber, on 27 December 1682. She had five children by Purchas (three sons and two daughters). After Purchas's death in April 1697, she married Robert Danby of Northallerton in 1698, without her mother’s approval. She died on 17 December 1726 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Stonegrave.",

He became a lecturer at St Clement Danes without Temple Bar in 1587. Suffering with poor health, he died on 4 July 1591 and was buried at Husbands Bosworth. While he has been described as the most popular Puritan preacher of the Elizabethan era, Smith had little time for separatist ideas and his avoidance of controversial theological issues made his sermons very popular. Over twenty editions of his collected sermons were published between 1592 and 1675.",

According to Thornton, Tancred bet her cousin, Lady Mary Yorke, that Thornton would marry Thomas Comber within a month of her husband’s death. He renovated Arden Hall in 1680. Tancred died, aged 80, on 26 February 1711 and was buried at All Saints’, Hawnby in the same grave as his wife, who predeceased him.",

He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in April 1680, before moving to University College, Oxford in May 1682. In 1687 he became the rector of Oddington, Gloucestershire but resigned later that year. By 1688 he was in considerable debt and in 1689 he was working as a chaplain on a naval ship. In 1691 he was offered a living in Northamptonshire but swapped it for that of Boldon in the diocese of Durham and resided at the Deanery in Durham with his sister, Alice, and her husband, Thomas Comber. In 1692 Comber helped arrange a marriage for him, to a woman worth £2800, but he fell ill and died on 4 June 1692, aged 29. He is buried in the Chapel of the Nine Altars, Durham Cathedral.",

He married the twice-widowed Elizabeth Denton (née Oglethorpe). In 1645 he was elected 'recruiter' MP (filling a vacancy caused by a by-election) for Richmond. During the second English Civil War he played an important role organising parliamentary forces in the north and was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1648. While named commissioner to try the king in January 1649 he took no part in it. In February 1649 he was appointed to ride the northern circuit, which included Yorkshire. He was judge on this circuit for the winter assizes from 1649 (when still a serjeant) to 1653 and the summer assizes 1649-51 and again in 1659. On 1 June 1659 he was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Beverley in 1654 but was prevented from sitting due to his refusing to try fellow Yorkshiremen after Penruddock's rising. He took up his seat in 1659 but his legal career was ended by the restoration of Charles II in 1660. He died intestate and was buried at All Hallows’, Bardsey on 7 June 1665.",
