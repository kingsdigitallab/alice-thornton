Alice Wandesford Thornton (1626-1707) wrote four manuscript books about her life, which was largely spent in the North Riding of Yorkshire as a member of the landed gentry. She is currently best known through a composite edition of three of the books, published by the Surtees Society in 1875. However, the Alice Thornton’s Books project, based at the University of Edinburgh, is creating a digital edition of all four books (two of which have only recently been traced). The project will make the full text of all four manuscripts freely available for the first time, allowing users to see how Thornton revised her life story as well as to search for people and places named in her books. 

Alice was born in Kirklington on 13 February 1626 and baptised at St Michael’s parish church six days later. She was the fifth child and youngest daughter of Christopher Wandesford (1592-1640) and his wife Alice Osborne (1593-1659). Her father was MP for Aldborough in 1621 and 1624, for Richmond in 1625 and 1626, for Thirsk in 1628, and deputy constable of Richmond and Middleham castles in 1630. Thornton records one of her earliest memories as tripping on a hearth stone, aged three, at Kirklington Hall, where they lived, and cutting her head open. The Hall, built c.1570 for the Wandesfords, is still in family hands but was much remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Alice and family moved to Dublin after 1633, when her father took up a government role there but fled back to England after Wandesford’s death (1640) and the Irish rebellion of 1641. The journey from Cheshire, where their boat landed, to Yorkshire (‘our own country’) was a long and arduous one due to civil war fighting. When they reached Lady Wandesford’s property, Hipswell Hall, they had Scottish soldiers billeted there and Thornton writes that she had a lucky escape from one Captain Robert Innes who wanted to marry her and planned an abduction, when she was aged about eighteen. Hipswell Hall was a fortified manor house (now a farmhouse). Still extant above the porch door is the inscription ‘GW 1596’, a reference to the alterations made to the fifteenth-century property by George Wandesford (1573-1612), Alice’s grandfather, in that year.

Alice stayed on at Hipswell Hall after her marriage in 1651 to William Thornton (1624-1668), a member of the lesser gentry from Ryedale, as he did not yet have the funds to rebuild his family property at East Newton. They visited his family the following year, during Alice’s first pregnancy. His sister, Mary Crathorne, was at Crathorne, Hambleton. His uncle, Richard Darley, was at Buttercrambe, Ryedale. Other relatives were in the East Riding: his sister, Anne Langdale, lived in Ellerby, Scarborough and his mother, Elizabeth Gates, at Burn Park, Cottingham. On the return journey, Alice had to climb down Whitestone Cliff, and later blamed the exertion involved for her first child only living a few minutes.

It was only in 1660, when Alice’s younger brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford (1628-1687), inherited Hipswell Hall from their late mother, that the Thorntons moved out. Initially, they went no further than her aunt and uncle’s house at St Nicholas, Richmond, as Alice was heavily pregnant. There she gave birth to her sixth child, William, who only lived for eleven days. 

That summer they made the move to William Thornton’s ‘country’, Ryedale. For Alice Thornton, this was a culture shock: ‘removed from my own country and friends and relations, the preaching of God’s word and the Holy Sacrament according to the Church of England’. They initialled stayed with John Denton, William’s brother-in-law, in Oswaldkirk. In her books, Thornton portrays Oswaldkirk as a hotbed of Presbyterians. Denton was the minister of St Oswald’s until 1662 when he was ejected for non-conformity. In that year Alice, fearing death when pregnant for the seventh time, called Dr Peter Samways, rector of Wath and Bedale, to visit their remodelled home at East Newton and give her communion, as she has not received it for two years. 

But Alice Thornton did settle in the area, remaining until her death in 1707. In large part this was due to the Thorntons helping a young curate, Thomas Comber, secure the living of Holy Trinity, Stonegrave. Comber married Thornton’s oldest daughter and he took over ownership of the East Newton property in 1692, when her only son died, to help Thornton with her debts. In that year he was also installed as Dean of Durham and became chaplain-in-ordinary to the joint monarchs William and Mary, although he continued to hold the livings of Stonegrave and nearby Thornton-le-Clay.

Thornton recalls that she brought offcuts of the fashionable plane (sycamore) trees planted at Hipswell so that she could set them 'in rows and walks in the front of my house’. In her will, she requested that five pounds be disbursed to the poor of the parish of Stonegrave but also to those in Kirklington and Hipswell, suggesting that she never forgot her own roots. She was buried in Holy Trinity church with a simple gravestone, marked ‘Madam Thornton, 1706’ (Lady Day dating).

Her books, which she left in her will to her eldest daughter, are full of references to Yorkshire people and places. There is already a partial release of the edition on our website - https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/ - and, as we issue further releases over the next year, we hope that YAHS members and many others will find it an invaluable resource.
