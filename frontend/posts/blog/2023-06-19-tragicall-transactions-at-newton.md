Last month, Cordelia Beattie wrote a [blog post](https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2023/05/bringing-up-a-chicken-to-peck-out-their-eye-a-nieces-betrayal.html) for the British Library's *Untold Lives* series, about Alice Thornton's account of her betrayal by her niece, Anne Danby. As Thornton's account goes, she had housed and fed Danby and her maid Barbara Todd after they had been thrown out of their accommodation by Danby's sister-in-law in 1667, only to be repaid with Danby, Todd and some of Thornton's maids spreading rumours about Thornton's relationship with her daughter Nally's suitor, Thomas Comber, which came to light in summer 1668. Comber was also living at the Thornton's house at East Newton, while he was curate of Stonegrave minster, the Thorntons' parish church.

The rumours were twofold; that Thornton and Comber were conducting an extramarital affair and that her designs for a match with Nally were purely so she could continue this affair; and that Thornton had given her incapacitated husband William's money to Comber. Thornton's story went that not only had Danby conspired with Thornton's aunt, Anne Norton, and Anne's daughter, Mary Yorke, to have the match broken off, but that she had also conspired to have Comber married to other eligible local women. One was her friend, Mrs Batte. The other was Katherine Farrer.

A letter from Danby to Parson Farrer, surviving only on microfilm at the North Yorkshire County Record Office, gives a detailed insight into Danby's side of the story, which is unsurprisingly different to that of Thornton. The letter is dated 10 December, without giving a year, but it is safe to presume that it is 1668, just three weeks after Nally and Comber were married on 17 November, since the opening of her letter states, 'I heard yesterday the supposed blessed wedding at Newton is consummated'.[^1]  

Throughout the letter Danby presents herself as the devoted niece, concerned only for her aunt's wellbeing, even when her aunt had grown cold towards her. She tried to make amends at every opportunity, to be rebuffed by Thornton. According to Danby, it was hers and Thornton's maids who were the source of the rumours about Thornton and Comber's relationship. Danby herself had merely stepped in when she found out they were being spread and told them to stop. This, she claimed, had led to her implication in the spreading of rumours.

Danby argued that one reason her aunt became cold towards her was that Thornton planned to have Nally and Thomas Comber married without the consent of Thornton's husband, William. Danby thought this to be problematic, and urged her aunt to reconsider, out of concern for her:

> She had a design to have married or contracted her daughter and Mr Comber privately without my uncle's knowledge, which my conscience would not permit me to condescend to, believing it to be very unjust, therefore I clearly dissuaded her against it, and told her (amongst other things) she was her father's child as well as hers and there ought to be a joint consent if she desired a blessing from God upon the future part of their lives.[^2]

Nally was 14 in summer 1668. Just 15 years previously, under the Barebones Parliament of 1653, girls under 16 had been required to have the consent of their parents to be married. This was no longer the case, but ideas about marriage and consent had been in flux during the political and religious upheaval of the mid-17th century.[^3] In any case, Danby was concerned that Thornton had not made the decision to marry Nally to Comber without her husband's consent. 

The other problem, Danby implies, was Comber's character. While Thornton sang his praises, Danby had heard otherwise:

> She representing him to be so good and holy and chaste and one of so excellent and rare parts, that she could never have the like husband again for her daughter, I had no great reason to oppose her, until I had the contrary attested to me, which me, a true friend, I did signify to her that she might not be deceived in so grand a concern, he being no such man as she believed, or would make me believe he was. But ever since, he hath sat on my skirts by the alienating her affections, for had it not been for him I might still say I have not I had a dear friend of my Aunt Thornton.[^4]

The implication here is that Comber was not chaste, and after she had relayed this to her aunt, Comber had 'sat on her skirts' -  that is, punished her severely[^5] - for revealing this about him. On the day Thornton found out about the rumours and fell ill, Danby recounts:
Ttowards the evening came in Hector Comber and gave me such a ranting lecture that I never had the like since I drew breath. He told me I and my maid had invented a company of lies on purpose to kill my aunt, and all the other stories that went about the country concerning him were all of my inventing too. 

Quite why Danby refers to Comber as 'Hector' here is a mystery - perhaps a reference to his hectoring tone? In any case, Danby portrays a situation where she and her maid were blamed for all the rumours that circulated about Comber, both regarding his character and his supposed affair with his prospective mother-in-law, and that these had been spread beyond the household.

Even after Danby had been ejected from her aunt's house and was living in lodgings at York, she attempted to reconcile with her aunt, sending her gifts, but was snubbed:

Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons"){.media-right}

> Though she had prosecuted me this violently, that I might give her some small testimony of my unextinguished affection, I sent her first a pot of anchovies, next a barrel of pickled oysters. After, I sent a messenger on purpose to inquire of her health with butter, a hundred raw oysters (which I knew she well loved) and two letters, the one relating to my vindication of which particular she so unjustly taxed me with all, and the other to condole with, and give her what consolation I could, concerning her late loss. But I was glad to reward my messenger myself and had my letters returned back, with this message, that she thanked me, but desired I would not put myself to the trouble of sending any more to her.[^6] 

Even after such treatment by her aunt, Danby portrays herself as still doing her best to make amends as a dutiful, loyal niece, always hoping for reconciliation.

Why was Anne Danby writing to Parson Farrer? We do not know much about him, but he was possibly the same George Farrer who was baptised at Coxwold on 28 October 1610, the son of Nathaniel Farrer of Close House.[^7] A George Farrer was ordained minister of Thornton Watlass in 1635, to whom Sir Thomas Danby - Anne's father-in-law - was patron.[^8] Thornton mentions Mr Farrer at Malton in the late 1660s, and Farrer may have been a chaplain at the Malton household of the Eure family.[^9] Given his age, and the information from Danby's letter that Katherine was a relation of George, he was likely Katherine's father or perhaps uncle. Given that Danby had been implicated in suggesting a match between Katherine Farrer and Comber, this might explain why Danby wrote George Farrer this letter to give her side of the story.

Was Anne Danby the dutiful niece she made herself out to be? Or, as her aunt claimed, had Danby been at the centre of the rumours about Thornton, Comber and Nally?
