This Saturday 18 November the *Thornton's Books* team are hosting ['Alice Thornton's Cafe'](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/news/2023-10-30-being-human-cafe/) at Starbank Park, Edinburgh as part of the Being Human festival. Here, project postdoc Jo Edge talks about some of the herbal remedies used by Alice Thornton and recorded in her autobiographies.

> I give unto my dear daughter Comber all my physic books and recipes, together with my stock of salves and ointments, desiring her to give unto her sister Katherine Danby what she may have occasion to use for herself or her children.[^1]

This extract from Alice Thornton's will, made in 1705 before her death in 1707, tells us that Thornton owned multiple medical books and recipes, as well as remedies, which she passed down to her eldest daughter, Alice (Nally) Comber, for the use of both herself, her sister Katherine Danby, and Danby's children. That Thornton was a medical practitioner is not out of the ordinary. Educated, literate women in the seventeenth century, who were in charge of the domestic sphere, had a good deal of basic medical knowledge, and access to remedies. That Thornton left these resources, presumably accumulated over many years, to her female descendants illustrates the gendered nature of medical roles. Aside from midwives, professional medical practitioners - surgeons, apothecaries, and physicians - were male. But domestic medicine - the home treatment of wounds and cuts, aches and pains, and the day-to-day management of chronic conditions - was performed by women.

During the course of her four books Thornton regularly refers to the medical issues suffered by herself, her family and her friends. The Thorntons were members of the upper gentry and could and did pay for the services of medical professionals when needed. Thornton's brother-in-law, Timothy Portington, was an apothecary in Malton, and they also used the services of the York physician Robert Wittie. But by far the most promiment medical practitioner in Thornton's books is Thornton herself, and her descriptions of administering medicine show that she was highly read, with access to knowledge and remedies - including herbs and plants.


The medicinal properties of certain herbs and plants has a history as long as time. The earliest attestations are from Sumeria, from around 3000BC, written on clay tablets. By the seventeenth century, herbals were still going strong. And the 17th century had something the Sumerians and medieval Europeans didn't have to circulate this information – print. And, this was a time of rapidly expanding literacy. Thornton was a highly educated woman of noble birth, firmly in the ranks of the upper gentry once she married. Thornton discusses a range of herbal and plant-based remedies in her books, and here I'm going to talk you through a few of these ingredients and tell you what her near-contemporary commentator Nicholas Culpeper (1616-54) said about them in his [*English Physitian*](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A35365.0001.001?view=toc) of 1652.

## Camomile for stitches

> It pleased God to vissitt my Deare & hon.red mother The Lady Wandesford, with her last Sickenesse. uppon friday the 17th of november 1659 beginning then with an exceeding great Cough; which tormented her Bodie with stitches, in her breast, & troubled her with short breathing; These stitches contineued about 14. daies together hindering her from almost any sleepe or rest, in so much that it was wonderfull how she could subsist. But uppon the use of bagges with fried oats, butter & camomiell chopt layed to her sides,  the stitches removed, & the cough abated, as to the extreamity thereof. (Book 1, pp. 165-6).

The Root of the Male Peony fresh gathered, hath been found by experience to cure the Falling-sickness; but the surest way is (besides hanging it about the Neck, by which Children have been cured) to take the Root of the Male Peony washed clean and stamped somwhat smal, and lay it to infuse in Sack for twenty four Hours, at the least, after strain it, and take first and last, morning and evening a good draught for sundry daies ... 

## Saffron for small pox
