In February 1655, Alice Thornton was in bed recovering from giving birth to her second daughter, Elizabeth (Betty), when her maid called out to her. Her one-year-old daughter, Alice (Nally), in her cot in the next room, was experiencing convulsive fits. Her maid Jane Flower and the midwife Jane Rimer were acting to save Nally. The fits stopped and started. The physical and mental effect that this sudden grief had on Thornton was profound:

>I [was] lying the next chamber to her and did hear her when she came out of them [i.e. her fits] to give great skrikes and so suddenly that it frightened me extremely. And all the time of this poor child's illness I myself was at death's door by the extreme excess of those, upon the fright and terror came upon me, so great floods that I was spent and my breath lost, my strength departed from me and I could not speak for fainting, and dispirited so that my dear mother and aunt and friends did not expect my life, but were overcome with sorrow for me. Nor durst they tell me in what condition my dear Nally was in her fits, lest grief for her added to my own extremity with loss of blood might have extinguished my miserable life.[^1]

Thornton experienced a flood (uterine bleeding), and the maids then moved Nally to a room further away, where her mother could not hear her cries and screams which were clearly putting her in mortal danger. As well as the flood, the shock of the incident had made Thornton's milk dry up and she wasn't able to breastfeed her newborn daughter for two weeks. But the story didn't end there. Just as Thornton was able to breastfeed Betty again, Nally fell into convulsions once more. A maid ran to her, saying that Nally was dead or nearly dead. Once again the physical effect on Thornton was intense:

>Which did so suddenly affright me being weak as before and this flood came down upon me as before, and they had much to do to get me carried safe into my bed again.[^2]

Luckily, Nally once again recovered, according to Thornton, thanks to God.

Thornton here describes a process which might seem melodramatic to the modern reader. She experiences a sudden shock of grief, which leads to a huge flux in her humours (uterine bleeding and the drying up of her milk). She is close to death, according not only to herself but to others around her. But God steps in to 'deliver' her from this terrible fate. This is a process that Thornton describes throughout all four of her autobiographical books, always caused by a sudden shock. I want to try and place this process in the context of both Thornton's writings and late-seventeenth-century understandings of medicine and the body.


## Alice Thornton's books


The precise emotion which causes the process Thornton describes is sudden grief. Thornton conceives of grief as being either caused by the endangerment or death of a loved one; or betrayal by someone close to her.

Thornton's husband William was not a financially prudent man, which led to some difficult situations for his wife. The big betrayal came two years before his death, in 1666, when Thornton discovered that William had cut her two surviving daughters Nally and Katherine out of their inheritance of the family property of Leysthorpe in order to pay off debts. This was as a result of another betrayal: her nephew by marriage, Henry Best, broke her confidence and told William of an error in the deed which meant he could annul it. When Thornton found out:

>...the very grief I apprehended was so great at that time on the discovery to me that it did force me to that miscarriage which I had and long continued sickness by the excess of floods which lasted a long time on me and mentioned in my first book.[^3]

Both Henry and William had betrayed her so profoundly that it caused her to suffer a miscarriage and months of excessive uterine bleeding. To Thornton's mind, this was caused by sudden grief provoking an excess of humours which forced her body to expel the foetus. Here's Thornton's description of the resulting illness taken from her first book:

>I fell into a very sad and desperate condition upon Saturday the 16th of August 1666, being then about 8 weeks gone, the violence thereof continued a long time after Dr Wittie was with me. And for 3 days he did not expect my life, so that he was compelled to use all his art for my preservation. But it pleased God upon the use of his medicines, that extremity a little abated, he leaving me in a hopeful way of recovery, only said I must not expect to be restored until about the latter end of October.[^4]

Thornton remained unwell until the following February.

In 1668 the most well-known betrayal of Thornton's life happened, when her niece-by-marriage Anne Danby, along with several maids in her own and Thornton's employ, was implicated in spreading rumours about the relationship between Thornton and her daughter's fiancÃ©, Thomas Comber. As a result, the marriage was almost sabotaged by Thornton's well-meaning relations. Earlier in the 1660s, Danby and her two children had come to live at the Thornton home in East Newton after being dispossessed. Thornton had clothed and fed her niece and her children out of the kindness of her heart, so the betrayal was even more upsetting. When Thornton found out about the rumours, her reaction was typical:

>I was cast down into my bed of sickness and weakness upon my woeful slanders which did torment me, and was likely to have killed me.[^5]

Very shortly after this incident, on 17 September 1668, William Thornton died aged 44 on a trip to Malton. On top of the Danby slanders, this sudden grief made her existing condition even worse:

>My fainting and weaknesses were so great and returned so strongly upon me all that night and for too days after that dear friends and my children did not expect, but when I should have departed, having lost so much blood in the flood that broke upon me by excess of grief at the first knowing of my slanderous accusation by Mrs Anne Danby and her maid Barbara Todd[^6]

How can we explain these seemingly-profound and perhaps rather alien experiences in Thornton? The answer lies in early modern understandings of the inner workings of the human body.

## Early modern bodies

![A 17th century page from a black and white anatomical book showing a diagram of the heart with its various parts labelled.](/assets/img/posts/'corporis_humani_highmore.jpg "Nathaniel Highmore, 'Corporis Humani Disquisitio Anatomica', 1651. Public domain, via Wellcome Images".)

As this anatomical drawing of the heart shows, early modern people were interested in the organs of the body. But, as Ulinka Rublack points out, what was really central to how the early modern body worked was the liquids within it - the four humours: blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm. An excess of any one of these caused illness, so, it was understood that a flux of one of these from any orifice of the body was a way of restoring the balance. Like its medieval counterpart, early modern medicine was based on the ancient medicine of Hippocrates and Galen.

It was the Galenic six non-naturals that caused bodily humours to go into imbalance. These were air, food and drink, rest and exercise, sleep and waking, excretions and retentions, and mental affections - the passions. It is the last of these that concerns us here. The passions - what we would today call emotions - came under increasing scrutiny after 1500, most notbly with Robert Burton's *Anatomy of Melancholy*, first published in 1621. Someone's emotional health had a significant impact on their bodily health.
