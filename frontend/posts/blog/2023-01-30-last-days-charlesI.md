We are nearing the anniversary of the execution of Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649. For Alice Thornton, looking back on this c.1669 when writing *Book 1: The First Book of My Life*, Charles I was a 'martyr'
who was 'cruelly murdered by the hands of blasphemous rebels, his own
subjects, at Whitehall, London, the 30th of January 1649'.[^1] 
Alice was from a royalist family, the Wandesfords, and maintained this
allegiance, even though the man she married in 1651, [William Thornton,
was more ambivalent about the monarchy](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-09-12-a-house-divided/).


But Thornton, in other writings, had more to say about the final days of
Charles I. She gave an account of a meeting, that took place at her
uncle William Wandesford's house in London, between Charles I and a
number of men who sought to persuade the king to acknowledge the justice
of the high court's proceedings in order to avoid execution. She
deposed that this was the day before he was sentenced to death which
would make it 26 January 1649. Her account was seen as noteworthy by
contemporaries but cannot be verified by other sources, with one recent
scholar sceptical about its veracity.[^2]

Charles Jackson in 1875 called this 'a curious account ... now lost',
which he accessed from a note in the 1799 edition of the *Memoirs of the
Life and Writings of Thomas Comber, DD*, her son-in-law, by another
descendant.[^3] The account, virtually verbatim, actually survives
in a letter dated 10 May 1710, five years after Thornton's death.
The letter is from George Paul, Vicar-General to the Archbishop of
Canterbury to Dr Cox Macro, clergyman and antiquarian, and Paul notes
that 'your fellow Collegian Laurence Eachard\' wanted it \'in order to
be mentioned in his History'.[^4]


Echard did indeed include it in volume 2 of his *History of England*
(1718), noting that 'I have received from a good friend a manuscript
testimonial of Mrs Thornton, a Yorkshire gentlewoman, daughter to Sir
Christopher Wandesford, who had been Deputy Governor of Ireland under
the Earl of Stafford... The person was generally esteemed for her worth
and piety and has given this following account, worthy of the reader's
notice'.[^5] 


Part of what makes the account so 'curious' is the named people said to
be at the secret meeting with Charles I. According to Thornton's
account, 'Mr Rushworth (author of the Collections)' had asked to use the
room, 'some days before'. On the day:

![alt text]({{"/assets/img/posts/Effigies_of_John_Rushworth_wmc_YaleCBA.jpg" | url}} "Title of image. Licensing stuff"){.media-left}

'There were about 12 of them, he \[William Wandesford\] saw several
disguised faces, particularly the Lord Baltimore and Mr William Lilly,
and others suspected by him to be papists, which strange mixture did
much amaze him.'[^6] 

John Rushworth, author of the *Historical Collections* (1659), had
strong ties to the parliamentarian cause.[^7] After the
Restoration, he was summoned to the House of Lords on 24 July 1660 to
answer the question, 'What he knows of a Meeting of Twelve Persons,
at *The Beare* of the Bridge Foot, concerning the Contrivance of the
King's Death?'. Rushworth denied knowledge of that meeting but did
admit knowing that some men were discussing a trial.[^8] 

Although Thornton's account refers to 'papists' in the plural, the only
known Catholic to be named is Lord Baltimore: Cecil Calvert, second
Baron Baltimore, announced his family were converting to Catholicism
c.1624. Lord Baltimore's colony in Maryland was at risk of being taken
over by parliament and so his presence might account for the reference
to the 'strange mixture' of people in attendance.[^9] 

The third named man was [William Lilly, an astrologer](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-10-25-black-monday-solar-eclipse-1652). He had published a pamphlet, *A Prophecy of the White Kings
Dreadfull Dead-Man Explaned* (1644), which predicted the end of the
Stuart monarchy and implied the violent death of Charles I, who he
accused of engaging in 'an uncivil and unnatural war against his own
subjects'.[^10] When Lilley wrote his own memoirs, first
published in 1681, he did not mention the meeting at Wandesford's house
but noted that he attended the trial of Charles I one day, saw Rushforth
there, and felt the questioning by the judge was 'audacious' and that
the king 'replied with great magnanimity and prudence'.[^11]

Echard included Thornton's account in his history as an example of those
who were deeply involved in the condemnation of Charles I 'but acted
with more privacy and behind the curtain', noting also that 'most of the
actors seemed still to have had some inclination to save the king's
life, if they could have had some terms of security'.[^12]
Thornton makes clear that her uncle knew nothing of the nature of the
meeting until after Charles I was executed: 'he understood afterwards to
his great grief, that such an odious consult should be within his
walls'.[^13]
