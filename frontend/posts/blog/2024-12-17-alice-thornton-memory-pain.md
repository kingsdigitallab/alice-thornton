Alice Thornton describes many medical encounters and illnesses in her four Books, and some episodes are recounted and retold in later volumes. In December 2022 I wrote [a blogpost](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-12-19-grief-and-illness-thornton/) on Thornton and traumatic illness, demonstrating the ways in which she conceived of and wrote about the effect that sudden emotional trauma had on her physical state. One question that has interested me since is how Thornton writes about the same instances of emotional pain across her four books. In October 2024 I had the chance to present on this topic at the University of Helsinki, as part of a conference organised by the [*Experiencing Agony*](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/experiencingagony/) team. 

In what follows, I look at how Thornton’s account of one particular instance of emotional illness — her [recovery from sickness, with the help of her aunt Anne Norton, in July 1668](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/entities/?hi=awt1_1668_slander_grief) — was revised. The sickness had been brought about by hearing [rumours had been spread about her by her niece Anne Danby and her maid](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2023-06-15-tragical-transactions-at-newton/), who were living at East Newton Hall with the Thorntons at the time.

While this [event](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-11-28-tei-events-thornton-books/) is recounted across all four Books, here I will focus on two different versions – from Book 1 (written c.1668–69); and in Book 3 (written c. 1692–96) to explore how Thornton's retelling of this illness changed with time.

In the earlier version in *Book 1*, the narration is contained within two paragraphs, that appear on consecutive pages, and runs to a total of 193 words: 

>And now I am to take notice of the grand mercies of my God that would not let me perish through the evil imagination of those that rose up against me, but after an immeasurable portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed fourteen days, weak and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he (God) raised me up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear aunt Norton's company, who, hearing of my sad misfortune and weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles.[^1] 

>Such was my dear aunt's care and charitable affection towards me, seeing me in such a deplorable condition of weakness and grief for these infinite wrongs and slanders, that she saw I did not take any comfort in my life, and that I could not sleep but still the frights and terror seized upon me, as if those two persons, which so abused me, were standing ready to tear my eyes and, as I fancied in my dreams, would have killed me. So grand an apprehension I had of those words and actions I have related.[^2]

Although relatively concise, this description provides a lively sense of the symptoms Thornton experienced as a result of this sudden emotional shock. She suffered with pains of the spleen and mother (the womb), and was ill for about two weeks, until – by God’s providence – her aunt came to help her. Thornton could not sleep, and her aunt understood that this was because of the 'frights and terrors' of the abuse by Danby and her maid. 

*Book 3*’s retelling, however, is much more detailed, occupying 2 pages and running to nearly 800- words. It is too long to reproduce in full here, but can be [viewed on our edition pages](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&p0.lo=p.87&p0.vi=modern&hi=awt1_1668_slander_grief), within the yellow markers. This account does not go into the physical details of Thornton's illness, but rather outlines the role of Anne Norton in bringing about Thornton's recovery. She helped faciliate the exit of Anne Danby from the household, something which was causing Thornton a great deal of grief. She also spoke to several of Thornton's friends and relations who had heard the rumours to set them straight – Isabel Wyvill, Peter Samways, and Mary Yorke. She facilitated spiritual comfort in the bringing of Samways over to Thornton to pray with her. We also hear details of how much she paid Anne Danby on leaving – two separate payments of £3 and £5, and the hiring of Susannah Graham's coach to take her away to York.[^3].

This is a much fuller account, then, than that in *Book 1*. And other evidence backs up some of these details: a letter from Anne Danby to one Parson Farrer, written in December 1668 or 1669, confirms much of this: Danby was allowed to stay for some time at East Newton after the discovery of the rumours; her aunt Thornton was very ill when she departed; Thornton gave her some money as a 'donation' on two separate occasions when she left; that a coach had been borrowed; and the key role of Anne Norton in the affair.[^4]

Is it possible that the passage of time by the 1690s had given Thornton the mental space and distance from this distressing event to write more freely about its awful details? It was also the case that — as noted by Thornton herself in *Book 2*, written c.1685–95[^5] — many of the people involved in the scandal were now dead, possibly including Anne Danby herself, who died in 1695. Perhaps this retelling served as a release, of sorts, with Thornton in her late 60s by the time *Book 3* was written. Anne Norton, who had come to Thornton's aid during this terrible episode, had died in 1683, and *Book 3*'s account almost reads like a memorial to this beloved aunt, who had served as a mother figure to Thornton since her own mother's death in 1659. What is more certain, is that Thornton’s revisions challenge any assumption that the earlier account might be the more fulsome.
