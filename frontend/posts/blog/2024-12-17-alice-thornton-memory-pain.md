Alice Thornton describes many medical encounters and illnesses in her four Books, and some episodes are recounted and retold in later volumes. In December 2022 I wrote [a blogpost](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-12-19-grief-and-illness-thornton/) on Thornton and traumatic illness, demonstrating the ways in which she conceived of and wrote about the effect that sudden emotional trauma had on her physical state. One question that has interested me since is how Thornton writes about the same instances of emotional pain across her four books. In October 2024 I had the chance to present on this topic at the University of Helsinki, as part of a conference organised by the [Experiencing Agony](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/experiencingagony/) team. 

In what follows, I look at how Thornton’s accounts of one instance of emotional illness were written and rewritten, offering some thoughts as to why her accounts of this episode become more detailed with the passage of time. While we think that the *Book of Remembrances* was largely written c.1659–68 and *Book 1* c.1668–87, *Book 2* was written c.1685–95 and *Book 3* as late as c.1692–96.

I will focus on an example of shock-illness-near death-deliverance cycle, which was the result of discovering rumours spread by her maids and her niece, Anne Danby, [about her relationship with her daughter Nally’s suitor, Thomas Comber](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2023-06-15-tragical-transactions-at-newton/), in July 1668. Both Danby and Comber were living with the Thorntons at East Newton Hall: Comber, as he was curate at Holy Trinity, Stonegrave, the Thorntons’ local church, and Danby (with her maid) because they had nowhere else to go in the wake of being left destitute by her newly-widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Danby.

On finding out these rumours had been spread by people within her own household, Thornton immediately became very ill, an episode she discusses in all four of her Books. Here is how she describes the incident in the *Book of Remembrances*:

>And lo, when I was yet scarcely recovered of my weakness from this grief and had kept my bed 14 days, it pleased God in his infinite and abundant mercy and goodness to begin to restore that most valued jewel by me and which was endeavoured to be wronged — my good name — by the coming of my dear aunt over to Newton, who had heard the vile reports blazed abroad by Mary Breakes and lies against my innocent soul.[^1]

*Book 1*’s account is more detailed:

>after an immeasurable portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed fourteen days, weak and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he raised me up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear aunt Norton's company, who, hearing of my sad misfortune and weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles.[^2] 

*Book 2* gives this account:

>I had likewise the great comfort of several dear friends which came to see me and stayed some time until the extremity of my passion of grief was mitigated (by which I was almost killed). These, I thank God, was so fortunate as to return much satisfied of the goodness of God, who would not suffer me to lie too long under the scourge of the tongues of malicious persons but, even in the midst of this misery, gave me some relief (lest that by the multitude of sorrows my life should be swallowed up)[^3]

*Book 3*’s retelling is much more detailed:

>My dear aunt was so concerned to hear I had been so belied that she immediately came to Newton and found me in a manner half dead with grief, upon this alarm that Mrs Danby and her maid raised up against me. I was extremely overjoyed to see her and blessed God for that providence which brought her thither though, at first, they had possessed her with some fears — though never of my giving cause of scandal — that I had been unfortunate in lighting upon some treachery from those of a contrary judgement.
Indeed, her apprehension had some ground for it — being placed amongst so many contrary opinions, who was glad of any pretence to make me not so desirable — for those two factions (of popish and presbyterian) had been some occasion to choose a match for my daughter to secure my children from that education. This, joined with others' self-interests, which was contrary to mine, all made up a cabal with those of my enemies to take fire and spread my misfortune that was raised against me.
...The excellent comfort, ease and refreshment I received from and by my dear aunt's counsels and prayers and good advice in my trouble, I have great cause to remember with highest gratitude to my heavenly Father who sent me such relief, I may say, from heaven; having a friend nearer than a brother which did succour me in this deep distress and when she brought Dr Samways with her to pray for me, having stayed with me until she saw Mrs Danby sent away to York.[^4]

So, in the *Book of Remembrances*, Thornton says she was ill for 14 days, and that her aunt came to visit, which helped her recover. We learn nothing about the illness itself. *Book 1* says a bit more, mentioning pains in the mother (the womb) and spleen among ‘other sicknesses’. One or both of these books was probably intended for circulation among her peers in the fairly immediate aftermath of the scandal, it is likely that accounts of this were written closer to the time of the incident described than much later, especially since Thornton mentions in *Book 3* that she was writing about her widowhood in *Book 1* in February 1669, and the material about the slander comes before the material about her widhowhood in that Book.[^5]

However, *Book 2* and *Book 3*, written between 1685–96, give more detailed accounts of the symptoms of the illness: here, a ‘flood’ of humours and losing blood (which could here mean vaginal or rectal bleeding). Also present in these accounts are the fears of Thornton and others around her that she would die. These are absent from the accounts given of this in the earlier books.

Therefore, the later Thornton's account, the more detail and emphasis she gives to this incident, which might seem counterintuitive, since you might expect a fresher memory of an event to be more detailed. But Thornton wasn’t writing from memory – she refers back to her previous books in *Book 2* and *Book 3* and expects that her readers will do the same.[^6]  

The paucity of information in the accounts in the *Book of Remembrances* and *Book 1* might be explained by emphasising the seriousness of the illness, while making any counteraction of the details difficult. Those who had been present when Thornton was very ill were still very much alive and apparently talking about the incident – not least, Anne Danby, who Thornton stated was spreading the rumours in Ripon, Richmond and further afield.[^7]  

Did Thornton add more detail in the later accounts in *Book 2* and *Book 3* because the people involved in the scandal were no longer alive? She certainly makes the point about many involved being dead in *Book 2*.[^8] A bloody flood would certainly be memorable to anyone present at the time, as well as fears of death ascribed to others who were present – and the paucity of information cannot be put down to propriety, as Thornton shares graphic accounts of her own floods and fluxes elsewhere in these earlier books. Furthermore, it was not just Thornton’s detractors who had died: Anne Norton, her aunt who came to care for her in the aftermath, died in 1683, before *Book 2* was begun in 1685, and Daphne Lightfoot, who came to look after Thornton once Norton had departed, died in 1689, which is during the time *Book 2* was thought to be written, and before *Book 3* was begun.

'Richmond draft parish register, 1680–91', PR/RM 1/4/8. North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton.")

In any case, Thornton’s memory of this awful episode in her life did not diminish as she got older: either the passage of time had given her the mental space and distance from the traumatic event to write more freely about the incident and recall its awful details; or it gave her the freedom to embellish the account with information that could only be countered by an increasingly small number of people. Furthermore, there is no evidence that *Book 2* and *Book 3* were intended to be circulated beyond close family, unlike the *Book of Rememembrances* and *Book 1*, so Thornton perhaps did not expect many to read what she had written.
