Alice Thornton describes many medical encounters and illnesses in her four Books, and some episodes are recounted and retold in later volumes. In December 2022 I wrote [a blogpost](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-12-19-grief-and-illness-thornton/) on Thornton and traumatic illness, demonstrating the ways in which she conceived of and wrote about the effect that sudden emotional trauma had on her physical state. One question that has interested me since is how Thornton writes about the same instances of emotional pain across her four books. In October 2024 I had the chance to present on this topic at the University of Helsinki, as part of a conference organised by the [*Experiencing Agony*](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/experiencingagony/) team. 

In what follows, I look at how Thornton’s account of one particular instance of emotional illness was written and rewritten: her [recovery from sickness, with the help of her Aunt Norton, in July 1668](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/entities/?hi=awt1_1668_slander_grief). The sickness had been brought about by hearing that [rumours had been spread about her by her niece Anne Danby and her maid](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2023-06-15-tragical-transactions-at-newton/), who were living at East Newton Hall with the Thorntons at the time.

This [event](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-11-28-tei-events-thornton-books/) is a useful example to think about the writing and rewriting of emotional pain, as it is recounted across all four Books. What I will do here is take an example of an earlier account — that in *Book 1*, written close to the event in c.1668—69; and compare it with that in *Book 3*, written about 25 years later, between 1692—96, to see how Thornton's retelling of the account changed with time.

Here's is *Book 1*’s account, which is in two separate paragraphs on consecutive pages:

>after an immeasurable portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed fourteen days, weak and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he raised me up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear aunt Norton's company, who, hearing of my sad misfortune and weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles.[^1] 

>Such was my dear aunt's care and charitable affection towards me, seeing me in such a deplorable condition of weakness and grief for these infinite wrongs and slanders, that she saw I did not take any comfort in my life, and that I could not sleep but still the frights and terror seized upon me, as if those two persons, which so abused me, were standing ready to tear my eyes and, as I fancied in my dreams, would have killed me. So grand an apprehension I had of those words and actions I have related.[^2]

These two paragraphs tell us quite a lot. We learn some of the symptoms of Thornton's illness, brought about by sudden emotional shock. She suffered with pains of the spleen and mother (the womb), and was ill for about two weeks, until her aunt came to help her. Thornton could not sleep, and her aunt understood that this was because of the 'frights and terrors' of the abuse by Danby and her maid.

*Book 3*’s retelling, however, is much more detailed. It runs to nearly 800 words. An abridged version is below:

>My dear aunt was so concerned to hear I had been so belied that she immediately came to Newton and found me in a manner half dead with grief...When my dear aunt understood all those bitter pills I had prepared for me, she very much commiserated my condition and did use her utmost endeavour to find out the injurious practices against me...she played a true Christian's part to me in clearing my wronged innocency both to my Lady Wyvill, Mr Darcy, Dr Samways and my Lady Yorke...and when she brought Dr Samways with her to pray for me, having stayed with me until she saw Mrs Danby sent away to York (which I did, and borrowed Mrs Graham's coach to carry her, with a maid to wait on her. I also took my last leave of her and gave her other £3 to relieve her withal, added to the £5 I sent before to her, which made up the sum of £8 which she had then)...My dear aunt did not only give me this comfort but, after she went home, did me all the good offices imaginable as to set all my friends aright in their judgement of all my actions, and cleared my innocency by relating those passages she observed and heard the matters carried at Newton.[^4]

Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons.")

*Book 3*'s account adds myriad details not mentioned in the earlier report – not least that her aunt found her 'half dead with grief'. It furthermore gives a much fuller description of her aunt Norton's role in aiding her recovery, telling us that she gave counsel, brought spiritual comfort in the form of Dr Samways, and stayed with her until Anne Danby had left. We also learn the names of others who had heard the rumours, details of the money Thornton had given to Danby, and the borrowing of Mrs Graham's coach. Interestingly, a letter from Anne Danby to one Parson Farrer, written in December 1668 or 1669, confirms many of these details: Danby was allowed to stay for some time at East Newton; her aunt Thornton was very ill when she departed; Thornton gave her some money as a 'donation' on two separate occasions when she left; that a coach had been borrowed; and the key role of Anne Norton in the affair.[^3]

Is it possible that the passage of time by the 1690s had given Thornton the mental space and distance from this distressing event to write more freely about its awful details? It was also the case that — as noted by Thornton herself in *Book 2*, written c.1685—95[^5] — many of the people involved in the scandal were now dead, possibly including Anne Danby herself, who died in 1695. Perhaps this retelling served as a release, of sorts, with Thornton in her late 60s by the time *Book 3* was written. Anne Norton, who had come to Thornton's aid during this terrible episode, had died in 1683, and *Book 3*'s account almost reads like a memorial to this beloved aunt, who had served as a mother figure to Thornton since her own mother's death in 1659.
