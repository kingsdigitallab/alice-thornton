Alice Thornton describes many medical encounters and illnesses in her four Books, and some episodes are recounted and retold in later volumes. In December 2022 I wrote [a blogpost](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-12-19-grief-and-illness-thornton/) on Thornton and traumatic illness, demonstrating the ways in which she conceived of and wrote about the effect that sudden emotional trauma had on her physical state. One question that has interested me since is how Thornton writes about the same instances of emotional pain across her four books. In October 2024 I had the chance to present on this topic at the University of Helsinki, as part of a conference organised by the [*Experiencing Agony*](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/experiencingagony/) team. 

In what follows, I look at how Thornton’s account of one particular instance of emotional illness was written and rewritten: her recovery from sickness brought about by hearing that rumours had been spread about her with the help of her aunt, Anne Norton, in July 1668. 

This [event](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-11-28-tei-events-thornton-books/) is a useful example to think about the writing and rewriting of emotional pain, as it is recounted across all four Books. While we think that the *Book of Remembrances* was largely written c.1659–68 and *Book 1* c.1668–87, *Book 2* was written c.1685–95 and *Book 3* as late as c.1692–96, so there is upwards of a decade, possibly two, between the writing of the first account and the last. An important point to make is that Thornton wasn’t writing from memory – she refers back to her previous books in *Book 2* and *Book 3* and expects that her readers will do the same.[^1]

On finding out these rumours had been spread by people within her own household, Thornton immediately became very ill. Here is how she describes the incident in the *Book of Remembrances*:

>And lo, when I was yet scarcely recovered of my weakness from this grief and had kept my bed 14 days, it pleased God in his infinite and abundant mercy and goodness to begin to restore that most valued jewel by me and which was endeavoured to be wronged — my good name — by the coming of my dear aunt over to Newton, who had heard the vile reports blazed abroad by Mary Breakes and lies against my innocent soul.[^2]

*Book 1*’s account gives more detail about the symptoms of the illness:

>after an immeasurable portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed fourteen days, weak and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he raised me up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear aunt Norton's company, who, hearing of my sad misfortune and weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles.[^3] 

*Book 2* gives this account:

>I had likewise the great comfort of several dear friends which came to see me and stayed some time until the extremity of my passion of grief was mitigated (by which I was almost killed). These, I thank God, was so fortunate as to return much satisfied of the goodness of God, who would not suffer me to lie too long under the scourge of the tongues of malicious persons but, even in the midst of this misery, gave me some relief (lest that by the multitude of sorrows my life should be swallowed up).[^4]

*Book 3*’s retelling is much more detailed, running to nearly 800 words. An abridged version is below:

>My dear aunt was so concerned to hear I had been so belied that she immediately came to Newton and found me in a manner half dead with grief...When my dear aunt understood all those bitter pills I had prepared for me, she very much commiserated my condition and did use her utmost endeavour to find out the injurious practices against me...she played a true Christian's part to me in clearing my wronged innocency both to my Lady Wyvill, Mr Darcy, Dr Samways and my Lady Yorke...and when she brought Dr Samways with her to pray for me, having stayed with me until she saw Mrs Danby sent away to York (which I did, and borrowed Mrs Graham's coach to carry her, with a maid to wait on her. I also took my last leave of her and gave her other £3 to relieve her withal, added to the £5 I sent before to her, which made up the sum of £8 which she had then)...My dear aunt did not only give me this comfort but, after she went home, did me all the good offices imaginable as to set all my friends aright in their judgement of all my actions, and cleared my innocency by relating those passages she observed and heard the matters carried at Newton.[^5]

So, in the *Book of Remembrances*, Thornton says she was ill for 14 days, and that her aunt Norton came to visit, which helped her recover. *Book 1* says a bit more, mentioning pains in the mother (the womb) and spleen among ‘other sicknesses’, and also that her aunt Norton came to help. One or both of these books was probably intended for circulation among her peers in the fairly immediate aftermath of the scandal, it is likely that accounts of this were written closer to the time of the incident described than much later, especially since Thornton mentions in *Book 3* that she was writing about her widowhood in *Book 1* in February 1669, and the material about the slander comes before the material about her widhowhood (which began in September 1668) in that Book.[^6]

*Book 2*'s account is interesting for what it doesn't include: any mention of Aunt Norton in helping her recovery, just the more general 'dear friends'. Whether this omission was purposeful or not is impossible to answer, but it is certainly noteworthy.

*Book 3*'s account is by far the longest. It adds details not mentioned earlier – not least that her aunt found her 'half dead with grief' – this dramatic flourish was not included in earlier accounts. It furthermore gives a much fuller description of her aunt Norton's role in aiding her recovery, telling us that she gave counsel, brought spiritual comfort in the form of Dr Samways, and stayed with her until Anne Danby had left. 

The telling and retelling of this incident throws up some interesting questions about the accounts written in the 1680s and 1690s, in *Book 2* and *Book 3*. It is possible that *Book 2*'s omission of Anne Norton's role is about the book's focus and intended purpose: it is preoccupied with her daughters and their inheritance, rather than the events of summer 1668, so this is perhaps simply explained by that.

In terms of the long account in *Book 3*, it seems that by the 1690s, nearly 30 years after the event and with Thornton well into her 60s, the passage of time had given her the mental space and distance from the awful event to write more freely and more at length about the details of the event. Here we learn the names of others who had heard the rumours, the money Thornton had given to Anne Danby, and the borrowing of Mrs Graham's coach. Anne Norton had died in 1683, about a decade before this account was written, and this also serves as a memorial to a much-loved aunt, who helped Thornton recover from one of the most distressing episodes of her life.
