As we gear up for [four days and nights of events](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/news/2023-07-26-durham-events-tickets-now-on-sale/) at Durham Cathedral, our project partner, here are 5 links between Alice Thornton and Durham Cathedral:

1.	Her daughter, also called Alice, married Thomas Comber who became Dean of Durham Cathedral in 1692.

2.	Alice Thornton’s son-in-law, Comber, spent £400 on the Deanery at Durham Cathedral, making it suitable accommodation for his wife and children; this would be [about £48,000 in today's currency](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/). When her son, Robert, got sick in 1692, he stayed at the Deanery.

3.	Robert Thornton, Alice’s only adult son and heir to the Thornton estate, died aged 29 on 5 June 1692 and is buried in the Chapel of the 9 Altars, Durham Cathedral. His sister, Alice Comber, commissioned a marble memorial tablet.

4.	Alice Thornton’s *Book 2: The First Book of My Widowed Condition* is in the Durham Cathedral library collection. In 1969 A.G. Hickson gave some family papers to the Cathedral library, initially catalogued as Dean Comber’s papers with a reference to a journal of his wife, Alice. [In 2019 Cordelia Beattie identified this](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-06-23-two-missing-thornton-manuscripts/) as Thornton’s *Book 2*.

5.	Alice Thornton’s *Book of Remembrances* is also now in the Durham Cathedral library collection. In 2019, Patrick Comber gave his collection of Comber family papers to the Cathedral, including the small book which Beattie had identified as Thornton’s *Book of Remembrances* [in 2018](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-06-23-two-missing-thornton-manuscripts/).
