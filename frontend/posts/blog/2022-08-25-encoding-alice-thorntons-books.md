Encoding highly complex texts like Alice Thornton's books is a process of interpretation in order to make explicit some of the underlying
structures and patterns in a text. How does text encoding in TEI XML
enable our project to turn Alice Thornton's books into a digital
scholarly edition and help to answer our [key
questions](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/about/)?

## Text encoding: what is it for?

In the words of the Women Writers' Project, “text encoding is a process
of transforming a source into data, using markup”.[^1] Markup in effect
embeds data directly into a text (by means of tags surrounded by \< and
\> signs), which a computer can recognise and process in various ways,
while still being (just about) readable by humans.

The [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/) XML schema is
not the only possible option for a project like ours. But it's widely
used to create digital editions of historical texts and Alice Thornton's
Books has chosen it for several reasons, not least:

- its focus on the _meaning_ of text before appearance
- it's been designed by and for the research community

TEI has evolved over three decades to cover most of the possible needs
of a project like ours straight out of the box (and it can be customised
further). If I have a problem, it's very likely that I'll be able to get
help from the TEI community online. Also, using a well-known and
well-documented standard schema will make it much easier for future
projects to take our work and re-use it in ways we might not have
anticipated.[^2]

Alice Thornton's books have multiple potential audiences - in literature
and history (social, political, religious, gender, of medicine) - and
beyond academic readers (e.g. those interested in the British Civil Wars, local history, family history, women's history). Because we can mark up several different
“layers” of meaning within the texts, TEI makes it possible, in a sense,
to have multiple versions of the books within a single edition, catering
for varying perspectives.

- Structural: the major divisions of texts such as front/back matter,
  main body, chapters, paragraphs
- Page layout: page and line breaks, running heads, marginalia
- Word/phrase: authorial deletions and insertions, expansion of
  contractions, sic, etc
- Contextual: dates; people and places; bibliographical (especially
  biblical) references; events
- Editorial annotations and modernisation

## Order from chaos

As just one example, TEI includes elements to distinguish certain chunks
of text as people's names in the “sea of words”.[^3] But that's not
_quite_ enough on its own.

In a narrative text the same person might be mentioned in many different
ways: below is a list of just some of the various ways that Alice
referred to her son Robert. “Robert” or the nickname “Robin” are very
frequent, but in almost half of all mentions she doesn't use his name at
all. (There are some individuals whom Alice hardly ever calls by name,
especially her parents.) Often the variations are tiny, but a computer
will treat them as all different unless told otherwise. Conversely,
there are several distinct individuals who share a name or other form of
reference. There are eight other people whom Alice might refer to as “my
child”, as well as several people named Robert, including another Robert
Thornton.

### Selected mentions of Robert Thornton

| text of mention          | number |
| :----------------------- | :----: |
| Robert                   |   8    |
| Robin                    |   8    |
| Robert Thornton          |   5    |
| Robin Thornton           |   4    |
| my deare Childe          |   2    |
| his Person               |   1    |
| my 7th childe            |   1    |
| my child                 |   1    |
| my childe                |   1    |
| my Childe                |   1    |
| my deare & sweet Childe  |   1    |
| my deare & sweete Childe |   1    |

Fortunately, TEI also has methods to [link tagged
elements](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html) (of
all kinds) together. This enables us both to identify and link all the
variants of the same person _and_ to separate the ambiguous cases. We're
creating project databases for people and places, which will in turn
enable us to link them to other information, like the short biographies
that [Jo Edge](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/people/jedge/) has been
writing, and even to external sources. We can use all of this to enrich
the searching and browsing experience of users in the digital edition.

## A case study

Systematic markup also enables quantitative analysis. For example, we're
interested in the relationship between _Book 1: The First book of My
Life_ and the _Book of Remembrances_ (_Book Rem_). They're very similar
in many ways: they cover the same period from Alice's birth in 1626 to
her husband's death in 1668, often using much of the same language.
Moreover, they're divided into very similar chapters or sections, have
much of the same front matter, an “index” (really a table of contents)
and extra passages that Alice added at some time after the original
text.

The most obvious difference between them is that the _Book Rem_ is much
smaller than _Book 1_, at only about 1/3 the word count. So we might
speculate that _Book Rem_ is a kind of first draft, or a “pocket-sized”
edition.

Here I'll explore just two elements of the markup of the two books,
people and dates, beginning with a look at the 20 most frequently mentioned people in each book.

![Side by side bar charts of the 20 most frequently
mentioned people in two of Alice Thornton's Books. Her husband, mother
and father are the top three in each book, but after that there are several differences between books.]({{ "/assets/img/posts/most-mentioned-names-bar-chart-1.png" | url }} "Most frequently mentioned people in Book Rem and Book 1"){.media-center}

At first sight they do look broadly similar, with the same names in the top three.
But on a closer examination, there
are quite a lot of variations in rankings. It's easier to compare these
changes with a less common type of chart (known as a [slopegraph](http://seeingdata.org/taketime/inside-the-chart-slope-graph/)). In
addition to comparing the rankings, I've colour-coded the names
according to their family connection, Thornton or Wandesford (Alice's
birth family):

![A 'slopegraph' which shows the ten most frequently mentioned
people in two of Alice's books and highlights the changes in
their rankings.]({{ "/assets/img/posts/top-ten-names-slopegraph-1.png" | url }} "Comparison of top ten people in each book"){.media-center}

Only seven people are in the top ten in _both_ books. But more
intriguingly, four of the six members of the Thornton family are
mentioned more frequently in _Book Rem_ than in _Book 1_ and,
conversely, five of the six Wandesfords are mentioned more in _Book 1_
than in _Book Rem_.

This is mirrored in the comparative frequencies of mentioned dates in the two books
(it's important to remember that Alice married William Thornton in
December 1651). This chart shows that the two books' coverage of
Alice's early years and of the 1650s are quite similar; the big
differences are for the 1640s and 1660s.

![A density chart which plots the years of tagged dates in Alice's two books as percentages of the total, enabling comparison of the distribution of the dates.]({{ "/assets/img/posts/b1r-dates-density-chart-1.png" | url }} "Tagged dates in Book of Remembrances v Book 1 (1626-68)"){.media-center}

It's clear, then, that _Book 1_ is not simply a longer or more
polished version of _Book Rem_. In _Book 1_, as Ray Anselment has noted,
Alice's Wandesford family fortunes are much more significant.[^4] She added
a large amount of extra material about the series of traumatic personal and political
events from her father's death in 1640, the Irish Rebellion, Civil Wars
and Revolution and her brother's death in 1651. In _Book Rem_ these are
covered in brief entries that take up just 4 pages, and she focuses much
more on her marriage, children and the death of her husband. One of
the project's objectives is to deduce _why_ Alice decided to expand her
story of her life in the way that she did.
