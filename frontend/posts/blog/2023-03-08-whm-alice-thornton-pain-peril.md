For Women’s History Month 2023, we are posting a series of reflections on our first encounters with Alice Thornton and our changing relationship with her books from then to now. Feel free to get involved by sending us your own reflections on social media.

Second in the series is project postdoctoral researcher [Sharon Howard](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/people/showard/):

CN: childbirth and pain

I first encountered Alice Thornton almost exactly 24 years ago, during
the spring term of 1999 when I was studying for an MA in Women's and
Gender History at the University of York and took an option on [the body
in early modern England](https://web.archive.org/web/20040529230032/http:/www.york.ac.uk/depts/hist/gsp/Options/option_428562_Jenner.htm) with Mark
Jenner.
My interest in women's history had begun several years before that,
though, even before I went to university at Aberystwyth and got hooked
on early modern history (and a nostalgic wander through undergraduate
essays has reminded me that I grabbed every opportunity to write about
women and gender that was on offer).

I was introduced to Alice through the 1875
_Autobiography_ edited by Charles Jackson, in a seminar on pain and
childbirth. It's been noted that many readers have tended - as I did -
to focus on Alice's sufferings in illness, pregnancy and childbirth at
the expense of other equally significant themes in her books, an
emphasis partly influenced by Jackson's editing.[^1] But I think it was
also influenced by a new wave of research on early modern maternity from
the mid 1980s onwards, including key studies of the experiences and
meanings of pregnancy and childbirth for mothers.[^2] For me in 1999,
exploring this emerging field of research was exhilarating and I know I
was bowled over by this famous passage in the _Autobiography_:

> the childe staied in the birth, and came crosse with his feete first,
> and in this condition contineued till Thursday morning betweene two
> and three a clocke, at which time I was upon the racke in bearing my
> childe with such exquisitt torment, as if each lime weare divided from
> other, for the space of two houers; when att length, beeing
> speechlesse and breathlesse, I was, by the infinitt providence of God,
> in great mercy delivered.[^3]

Reading the _Autobiography_ against this background inspired an essay,
which became an article, in which I explored the way she wrote about
pain and peril, pregnancy and birth and the providentialism that underpins so much
of her writing.[^4]

But then I returned to what I had already decided I wanted to research
for my PhD: court records, crime and litigation. I spent much of the
next 20 years working on thieves and murderers, slanderers, bastard
bearers and brawlers. Alice would have mightily disapproved of most of
them. Nonetheless, that intervening research has undoubtedly shaped my
responses to her writing, and a rather different set of images and themes
have caught my attention this time around.

> and this fright joined with a hearty grief did bring me very low
> again, and I expected nothing but a sudden abortion and destruction of
> my poor infant in my womb.[^5]

Alice might have found more in common with [the petitioners
of my most recent research](https://petitioning.history.ac.uk/); the passage echoes many [petitioning (and other
legal) narratives](https://earlymodernnotes.wordpress.com/2020/08/13/women-gender-and-non-lethal-violence-in-quarter-sessions-petitioning-narratives/) I've been
reading,
from the deceitful, unjust malice of her enemies to the threat they
posed to both Alice and her unborn child.

Moreover, I now can't help but notice just how often Alice writes of
_petitioning_ God (and occasionally people). The prayers and meditations
in which this petitionary language are often found were frequently
omitted from the Jackson edition, and his omissions also downplayed the
importance of the slanderous attack on her reputation in motivating her to write
the books.[^6] I knew already that her writing was an 'act of
self-vindication'.[^7] But reading [her original manuscripts](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2022-06-23-two-missing-thornton-manuscripts/) has newly emphasised for me both the perils created by enemies actively plotting
the downfall of Alice and her family _and_ the importance of the [friends](<https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2024-03-01-alice-and-daphne/>) and
[relatives](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/blog/2023-02-13-AliceThorntonsHeart-Blog/)
who come to her aid. My focus may have shifted, but I
continue to be fascinated by Alice's words and her world.
