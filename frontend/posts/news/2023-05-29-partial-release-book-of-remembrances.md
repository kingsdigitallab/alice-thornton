In collaboration with our magnificent partners at Kings Digital Lab, we are delighted to announce that we have transformed the first twenty-two pages of our text-encoded files of Alice Thornton’s *Book of Remembrances* into a sample version of our digital edition. 

As it is only an initial release of a small sample of one book, some of the functionality that we aim to include in the final version is not yet fully operable. 

However, as the images below demonstrate, in this version you can view the texts in either modernised or semi-diplomatic format:

Or, by clicking on the button marked ‘clone’ – you can compare versions side by side:

For more information on current functionality - including tagging, annotations, images and editorial principles — please see our latest blog: *Book of Remembrances: Further Information about the Partial Release*.

We very much hope you like what you see, and we look forward to your feedback.
