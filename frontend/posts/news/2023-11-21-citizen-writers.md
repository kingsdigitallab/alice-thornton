On Tuesday 21st November, writers taking part in the Edinburgh International Book Festival’s [Citizen Project](https://ontheroad.edbookfest.co.uk/) and illustration students from Edinburgh College of Art have been invited for an evening talk by the Alice Thornton’s Books team. The writers and illustrators have been working together on a creative project about deliverances from death and life changing moments, a topic inspired by Alice Thornton’s accounts of her life. Professor Suzanne Trill, Professor Cordelia Beattie, and Dr Jo Edge will look at the 32 modern stories created by the writers, which are currently being illustrated by the students from Edinburgh College of Art. They will look at common themes in modern and 17th-century deliverances from death, and will demonstrate how creative writers could access the digital edition of Alice Thornton’s work for further writing inspiration and research.
