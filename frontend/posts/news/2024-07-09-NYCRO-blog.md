On 5 July 2024, the Thornton's Books team travelled to Northallerton for an afternoon of Thornton events at the North Yorkshire County Record Office. This consisted of a talk by Cordelia Beattie on Alice Thornton and her life in North Yorkshire, followed by Debbie Cannon's one-woman play, [*The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton*](https://debbiecannon.org/the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton/). There was also an exhibition of some key documents held in the archive relating to Alice Thornton and her family.

The documents on display are discussed and available to see in high quality in [this blog post](https://nycroblog.com/2024/07/04/alice-thornton/), by Cordelia Beattie and NYCRO Record Assistant Gail Falkingham.
