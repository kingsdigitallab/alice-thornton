On 5 July 2024, the *Thornton's Books* team descended on Northallerton for an afternoon of Thornton events at the North Yorkshire County Record Office. This consisted of a talk by Cordelia Beattie on Thornton's Yorkshire connections followed by Debbie Cannon's one-woman play, [*The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton*](https://debbiecannon.org/the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton/). There was also a temporary exhibition of some key documents held in the archive relating to Alice Thornton and her family.

The documents on display for the day are also available to see in high quality in [this blog post](https://nycroblog.com/2024/07/04/alice-thornton/), with descriptions and context provided by Cordelia Beattie and Record Assistant Gail Falkingham.
