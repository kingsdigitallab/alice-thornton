Project postdoctoral fellow Jo Edge has written a [short article](https://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/food/forbidden-fruit/) on melons in the early modern period for *History Workshop Digital Magazine*'s 'Eating the Past' series. 

Inspired by Thornton's recounting of her uncle Edward Osborne's death from eating too many melons in September 1647, Edge examines why the melon was both revered as an exotic fruit and feared as a dangerously cold and moist foodstuff in early modern Europe.
