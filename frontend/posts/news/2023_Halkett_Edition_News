# **Publication of Anne, Lady Halkett's *A True Account of My Life* and Selected *Meditations***

Suzanne is pleased to announce that her latest edition of Anne, Lady Halkett's autobiographical writing is now in print.

Born in the early 1620s to parents of Scottish descent who were servants in Charles I's household, Anne, Lady Halkett (n√©e Murray), grew up on the fringes of the English court during a period of increasing political tension. From 1644 to 1699, Halkett recorded her personal and political experiences in both England and Scotland in a series of manuscript meditations and an autobiographical narrative (*A True Account of My Life*). Royalism, romance, and contemporary religious debates are central to Halkett's vivid portrayal of her life as a single woman, wife, mother, and widow.

This edition, the only version of her writing to date available in a fully modernised edition, offers the opportunity to explore how Halkett's meditational practice informed her life writing and 'redefine[s] the importance of Halkett's contribution to seventeenth-century life writing' (Professor Raymond Anselment).
