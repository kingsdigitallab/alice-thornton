The Alice Thornton's Books team is hosting a book picnic in [Starbank Park](https://friendsofstarbankpark.org/), North Edinburgh, EH5 3BX, on Saturday 8th June. This is a free event for the whole community to enjoy. 

At 12:00 and 16:00 Cordelia Beattie and Jo Edge we will be inside Starbank House offering a short talk introducing Alice Thornton and her thoughts on food and health. They will also be answering questions in these 30 minute sessions. 

At 14:00, Cordelia Beattie will be in conversation with author [Kate Foster](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/kate-foster/43803), discussing early modern women in fiction and non-fiction. Kate will read from her novel *The Maiden*, a Times Bestseller and winner of the Bloody Scoltand Crime Debut set in seventeenth-century Edinburgh. She will also read from her brand new novel, *The King's Witches*, set in sixteenth-century Edinburgh. This hour-long event is supported by [The Scottish Book Trust](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/) and will be followed by a book signing with [Argonaut Books](https://argonautbooks.co.uk/).   

Guided walks of the park will begin from Starbank House at 12:30 and 16:30. Botanist, Heather McHaffie will introduce you to the poisons and poultices that would have been available to our fictional and non-fictional historical heroines.

The park will be open all day, with drop-in herbal-remedy themed crafts and creative writing activities available between 12:00 and 17:00.

For further information, and to book for our talks and our author event, visit our [Eventbrite page](https://alicethorntonpicnic.eventbrite.co.uk). Numbers are very limited, so be quick!

Please note, the event is not catered. The park is a great location to bring a picnic and a book to read.
