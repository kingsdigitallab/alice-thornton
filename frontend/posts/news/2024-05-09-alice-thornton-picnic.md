The Alice Thornton's Books team is hosting a book picnic in [Starbank Park](https://friendsofstarbankpark.org/), North Edinburgh, EH5 3BX, on Saturday June 8th, a completely free event for the whole community to enjoy. 

At 12:00 and 16:00 we will be inside Starbank House offering a 30-minute talk introducing Alice Thornton and her thoughts on food and health. Thornton was a 17th-century Yorkshire woman who survived fire, plague, rebellion and family life, and wrote about it all!  

At 14:00, Cordelia Beattie from the Thornton's Books team will be in conversation with author [Kate Foster](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/kate-foster/43803),discussing early modern women in fiction and non-fiction. Kate will read from her novel *The Maiden*, a Times Bestseller and winner of the Bloody Scoltand Crime Debut set in 17th-century Edinburgh, and from *The King's Witches* her brand new novel set in 16th-century Edinburgh. This hour-long event is supported by [The Scottish Book Trust](https://www.scottishbooktrust.com/), and will be followed by a book signing with Argonaut Books.   

Guided walks of the park will begin from Starbank House at 12:30 and 16:30. Botanist, Heather McHaffie will introduce you to the poisons and poultices that would have been available to our fictional and non-fictional historical heroines.

The park will be open all day, and drop-in herbal-remedy themed crafts and creative writing activities will be available between 12:00 and 17:00.

Please note, the event is not catered, but the park is a great location to bring your picnic and a book to read.
