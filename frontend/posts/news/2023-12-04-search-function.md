We now have a [search](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/entities/) function for people and places! Links that go to our partial release are live, others show up but are currently disabled; however, you can now see who appears and how often across all four books. [^1]

This includes some sample biographies for people mentioned in the partial release of the Book of Remembrances (including Lady Alice Wandesford (1593-1659), Christopher Wandesford (1592-1640) and his son Sir Christopher Wandesford (1628-1687)).

Also, if you look at the [Books](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/books/) page, we have updated the information provided about the material history of the four books, with most detail provided for the Book of Remembrances (description, provenance, dating).

We hope this whets your appetite for more and we will update you here and via social media as other materials become available.
