Cordelia Beattie (PI), Suzanne Trill (Co-I) and Sharon Howard (PDRA) will be speaking at 'How to do things with early modern words' at the University of Loughborough on 15 July 2022.

2021 saw the publication of the first volume of _The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Aphra Behn_. Editing Behn’s remarkable oeuvre has involved an international team of scholars, drawing on expertise from across the humanities. ‘How to do things with early modern words’ marks the 350th anniversary of the start of Behn’s career, and aims to celebrate and develop interdisciplinary approaches to early modern studies. Bringing together researchers working in literature, digital humanities, history, theatre history, and language in the 1500-1750 period, the conference will explore cutting-edge themes, perspectives and approaches in scholarship on the early modern world.

We will speak on our progress to date towards a digital edition of the four manuscript books of Alice Thornton. At this point in the project, we are focusing on why Thornton wrote four different autobiographical volumes and how they relate to each other. It is already clear that their contents raise questions about both the composition process and their intended audiences. To begin the process of addressing these questions, we have transcribed all four manuscripts, and begun the process of editing them and tagging them so that users could read them continuously as single volumes, side-by-side in semi-diplomatic transcription and modernised form, and/or compare variant accounts of the same events. Our panel will explore the practical and technical issues involved in the project and invite feedback from potential users of the digital edition.

[Registration](https://store.lboro.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/school-of-social-sciences-and-humanities/upcoming-events/how-to-do-things-with-early-modern-words-july-2022) is open until 1 July 2022.
