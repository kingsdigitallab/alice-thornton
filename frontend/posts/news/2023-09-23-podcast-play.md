In 2021, during lockdown, the writer and actor [Debbie Cannon](https://debbiecannon.org) was interviewed by Lottie Walker of [Blue Fire Theatre Company](https://www.bluefiretheatre.co.uk) about all things Alice Thornton. They talk about the one-woman play, ['The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton'](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/posts/news/2023-06-16-tickets-for-thornton-durham-play/), which we are now bringing to Durham Cathedral on [October 19 and 20th 2023, 7.30pm](https://durhamcathedral.ticketsolve.com/ticketbooth/shows/1173644589). The podcast has now been uploaded to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtSzOiDImPw).
