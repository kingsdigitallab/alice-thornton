On January 25th, 5:30 pm at London's [Institute of Historical Research](https://www.history.ac.uk/about-us/find-us), Cordelia Beattie (Principal Investigator) and Suzanne Trill (Co-Investigator) will give a paper on 'Alice Thornton's Books: remembrance and revision in a seventeenth-century woman's life-writing'. 

This talk is part of the IHR's seminar series on [British History in the 17th Century](https://www.history.ac.uk/seminars/british-history-17th-century). This seminar is one of the UKâ€™s leading centres for the dissemination and discussion of the latest research on 17th-century British and Irish history. It covers all aspects of British and Irish political history, including but not restricted to print and manuscript circulation, British and transnational communication networks, parliament and political institutions, political and religious ideas, urban political culture, politics and memory, migrant communities in Britain, and British migrant and exile communities overseas. 

This free event will also be live-streamed.
