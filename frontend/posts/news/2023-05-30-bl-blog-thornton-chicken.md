 Project PI, Cordelia Beattie, has written [a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20250318104513/https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2023/05/bringing-up-a-chicken-to-peck-out-their-eye-a-nieces-betrayal.html) for the British Library's blog series, 'Untold Lives', about the two Alice Thornton manuscripts in their collection, when they were written, and our current thinking about what prompted the composition of *Book 3: The Second Book of My Widowed Condition*. 

 Spoiler: it also discusses her pet chicken, an unfortunate eye injury and her niece's betrayal (and includes three lovely images from Thornton's books).
