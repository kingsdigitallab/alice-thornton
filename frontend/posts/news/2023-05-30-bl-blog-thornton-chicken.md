 Project PI, Cordelia Beattie, has written a post for the British Library's blog series 'Untold Lives', about Alice Thornton, her pet chicken, an unfortunate eye injury and a metaphor for her niece's betrayal.

This curious story is found in *The Second Booke of My Widdowed Condition* (our *Book 3*), which is one of the two Thornton manuscripts housed at the British Library, the other being *The First Booke of My Life* (our *Book 1*).
