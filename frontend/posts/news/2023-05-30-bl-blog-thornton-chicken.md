Project PI Cordelia Beattie has written a blog post for the British Library's blog series 'Untold Lives', about Alice Thornton, her pet chicken, an unfortunate eye injury and a metaphor for her niece's betrayal. 

This curious story is found in 'The Second Booke of my Widdowed Condition' (our *Book 3*), which is one of the two Thornton manuscripts housed at the British Library, the other being 'The First Booke of my Life' (our *Book 1*).
