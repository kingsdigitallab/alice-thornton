> In 2018-19, Cordelia Beattie located two missing manuscripts written by seventeenth-century Yorkshire woman, Alice Wandesford Thornton. One manuscript was in private hands and the other had been gifted to Durham Cathedral in the 1960s but had not been identified as a Thornton book. Alice Thornton lived during the period of the British Civil Wars and spent time in Ireland as well as England. In this talk, Cordelia will tell us why she wrote four accounts of her life, her connection with Durham and how two of her manuscripts ended up in the Cathedral library.

> Yorkshire, 1668. Mrs Alice Thornton – widow, mother, and daughter of the late Lord Deputy of Ireland - finds herself the subject of a most dreadful scandal. Tonight, she begs your presence at a defence of her life, including twenty miraculous deliverances from death. Based on the handwritten notebooks of Alice Thornton (1626-1707) – including two recently rediscovered manuscripts - this one-woman theatre/storytelling performance reflects on one woman’s life and experiences across the span of the seventeenth century, against the turbulent backdrop of civil war, plague, the Great Fire of London … and the treacherous world of North Yorkshire society.

Written and performed by Debbie Cannon (Green Knight, winner of the Female Actor Award at Buxton Fringe 2018), directed by Flavia D’Avila of Fronteiras Theatre Lab, and developed as part of the Alice Thornton's Books Project. Both performances will be followed by a Q&A.

## Finally, on Saturday 21 October at 7.30, Project Co-I Suzanne Trill will give a talk on 'Alice Thornton’s Books: God’s Seventeenth-Century Handmaid':

> As a result of Margaret Atwood’s avowedly dystopian novel, The Handmaid’s Tale, along with the ongoing television adaptation of the same name, the title may seem like an inauspicious place to begin. However, Alice Thornton’s seventeenth-century Books offer an alternative understanding of this phrase: defining herself as ‘God’s Handmaid’ gives Thornton agency, along with the assurance that God’s providence will protect her throughout the trials and tribulations of this earthly life. Her faith, specifically formulated within the liturgical practices of the Church of England in the 1630s and 1640s, framed her understanding of the events of her life. It is, therefore, no accident that Thornton’s remembrances of God’s deliverances of herself and her family, England and the church are comprised of meditations, prayers and thanksgivings. In this lecture, Dr Suzanne Trill will explore why being ‘God’s Handmaid’ was a positive thing for Thornton and discuss what her manuscripts reveal about women's roles within the Church of England during the seventeenth century.
