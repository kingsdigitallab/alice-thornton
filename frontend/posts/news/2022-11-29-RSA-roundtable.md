On 3 December, Cordelia Beattie (PI) and Suzanne Trill (Co-I) will take part in a roundtable on ‘Creative Approaches to Early Modern Women’.

The roundtable is organised by Naomi J. Miller (Smith College) and Sara Jayne Steen  (Plymouth State University) and chaired by James B. Fitzmaurice (Northern Arizona University), building on themes in their open access collection, [Authorizing Early Modern European Women: From Biography to Biofiction] (https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463727143/authorizing-early-modern-european-women).

Cordelia will be talking about her collaboration with [Debbie Cannon](https://debbiecannon.org) for the [Being Human Festival](https://www.beinghumanfestival.org/resources/case-studies/finding-right-format-remarkable-deliverances-thornton) in 2019, which resulted in the play [‘The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton’](https://debbiecannon.org/the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton/).

Suzanne will be talking about the audience feedback from this event and how the play changed her own view of Thornton.
