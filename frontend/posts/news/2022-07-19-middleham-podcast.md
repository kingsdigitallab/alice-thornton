Cordelia Beattie (PI) and Jo Edge (PDRA) will be discussing Alice Thornton’s story, including her connection to the English Heritage site of Middleham Castle in North Yorkshire in episode 173 of the weekly podcast.

Alice Thornton wrote four books, including three autobiographies, which provide a remarkable insight into life during the seventeenth-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Joining us to discuss Alice’s story, is English Heritage Properties Historian Will Wyeth.

The episode is released on Thursday 21 July 2022 and will be available here:
