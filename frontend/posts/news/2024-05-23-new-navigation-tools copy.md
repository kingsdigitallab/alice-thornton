As we move into the final phase of our project, in collaboration with KDL, we have made some changes to the organisation of our website and the text viewer that we hope will enhance your reading experience. This is part of our preparation for the launch of materials from the other *Books* and will help to make the later – and longer – texts easier to navigate.  

 

From the main navigation bar, you can now go straight to the semi-diplomatic and modernised editions of the first 103 pages of the *Book of Remembrances* and, whether you access this direct or via the ‘Books’ page, the look of the edition has been updated; for example, the edited text is now contained within scrollable panes.  

 

Although we have retained all the previous functionalities, some information is now in a different place. The page numbers of our edited version of the text now appear in the bottom left-hand side of the viewer, and you can now also navigate the pages using the arrow buttons on the right-hand side.   

 

We have also added an information button to the top of the page. For now, this only contains links to the search function and provides citation details. Over the next six months, we will be adding additional ‘drawers’ to this section (for example, a legend that will supply a key to our display decisions).

And, finally, in case you haven’t seen this already, you can now also navigate the published sections of the *Book of Remembrances* via a contents list (see ‘About’ in ‘Books’). As our other search functions (full text and by event) are not yet available, this may be of particular interest to those interested in specific types of events (deaths, deliverances, illnesses) or specific genres (such as prayers, meditations and thanksgivings) that Thornton identifies in her titles.

We hope you like the new look and would very much welcome your feedback (see button on the right-hand-side of your screen) as we prepare to publish more of ‘Alice Thornton’s Books’ at the end of June 2024.
