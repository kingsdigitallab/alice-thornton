We have reached the end of our AHRC-funded project and are delighted to announce that the full and final version of our Digital Scholarly Edition (DSE) of Alice Thornton’s Books is now available.  

There are now 1,019 pages (c. 270,000 words) of Thornton’s life-writings in which to immerse yourselves in both modernised and semi-diplomatic versions. 

This version presents some entirely new features:  

+ the Edition ‘Info’ panel now includes page level information: i.e., it lists the Notes and Entries on that page, with additional information 

+ a [Timeline](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/timeline/) that provides a visual representation of Alice Thornton’s life and plots the events included in her Books chronologically. 

+ print function (also via Edition 'Info' panel) 

The ‘About’ section has also been expanded to include further information ‘About Our Edition’ that provides our ‘Guidelines’ (i.e., the documentation relating to the process and principles by which the DSE was created), a ‘Bibliography’ of materials referenced in the Edition and details of the incredible team that comprised our [Project Advisory Board](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/about/)

Further, all 323 persons who feature in the Books have a biographical summary, and 44 places also have narrative summaries. 

Further information on these new developments can be accessed via accompanying blogs.
