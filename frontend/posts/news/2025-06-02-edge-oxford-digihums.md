On 19 June 2025, Dr Joanne Edge will be one of the speakers in ['From Pen to Pixel: Valorising Women's Manuscript Writings in Digital Humanities Projects'](https://www.mfo.ac.uk/event/pen-pixel-valorising-womens-manuscript-writings-digital-humanities-projects), part of the Channels of Digital Scholarship Seminar, Maison Française d'Oxford. This session will consider feminist approaches within digital humanities, and reflect on the challenges and future directions in the recognition and valorisation of these forms of writing and their material supports. Edge will be reflecting on her time as a postdoctoral researcher with the Alice Thornton's Book project (2021-4).
