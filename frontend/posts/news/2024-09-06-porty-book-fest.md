Cordelia Beattie (Principal Investigator), Suzanne Trill (Co-Investigator) and Eleanor Thom (Engagement and Impact Officer) will appear on October 4th 2024 at the Portobello Book Festival, Edinburgh, for a one-off talk and workshop 'Alice Thornton and her Digital Edition'.

 Beattie and Trill will introduce the project and how people can use the digital edition to explore the world of Alice Thornton and the topics she wrote about in the seventeenth century. Thom will then look at some work by local writers who have already been inspired by what they found in Thornton's books, and attendees will have a chance to compose their own mini-memoir.

Tickets to events are free, but must be reserved, and can be collected in person at [Portobello Library](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/directory-record/1229195/portobello-library) from Monday September 9th (max 4 per person). More details and the full programme are available from the [Portobello Book Festival](https://portobellobookfestival.com/).
