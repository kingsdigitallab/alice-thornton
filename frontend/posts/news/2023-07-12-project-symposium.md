As promised in our application for AHRC funding, the Alice Thornton’s Books team have organised a symposium that will take place over the next two days, 12 and 13 July 2023, in Edinburgh. For this gathering, we have invited a group of international scholars with specific expertise in different fields and disciplines. Last summer, we gave our participants access to our draft semi-diplomatic transcriptions of all four of the Thornton manuscripts so that we could all produce papers for pre-circulation. After the symposium, these papers will be revised for publication in an edited volume, entitled *Alice Thornton’s Life-Writings: Reassessing a Seventeenth-Century Woman’s Manuscript Books*, which will be published in open access format by [Amsterdam University Press](https://www.aup.nl/en/series/gendering-the-late-medieval-and-early-modern-world) in 2025.

The image, from the *Book of Remembrances*, describes a rather different gathering in which Thornton records her delight as she and her family can celebrate the Lord’s Supper at their new home in East Newton (August 1662).
