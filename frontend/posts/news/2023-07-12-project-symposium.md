The Thornton's Books project team and experts from institutions all over the world meet for two days on 12 and 13 July in Edinburgh to discuss pre-circulated papers for a forthcoming companion to Alice Thornton. Titled *Alice Thornton's Life-Writings: Reassessing a Seventeenth-Century Woman's Manuscript Books*, it will be published by Amsterdam University Press in 2024.

The image opposite from the *Book of Remembrances* describes a gathering at Thornton's East Newton house for the Lord's Supper (or communion) in August 1662.
