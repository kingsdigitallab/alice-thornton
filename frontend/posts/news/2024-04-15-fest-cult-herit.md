On Thursday 18th April, 11:30am - 1:30pm, the Alice Thornton's Books team will host a free interactive session 'Discovery and Digitisation: Alice Thornton's Life and Books (1626-1707)' at the [Festival of Cultural Heritage Research 2024](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/heritagefestival24/programme-of-events-and-activities/), an event organised by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Edinburgh, at St Cecilia's Hall. We will be on the 1st floor, in the Sypert Concert Hall.

We will demonstrate how we are turning Thorntonâ€™s seventeenth-century manuscripts into an open-access Digital Scholarly Edition (DSE) that both preserves her texts and changes our understanding of their cultural significance. Attendees will be introduced to her four autobiographical manuscripts and be offered unique access to sections of the DSE that are not yet available to the public. We'll have audio samples of Debbie Cannon reading her one-woman play, ['The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton'](https://debbiecannon.org/the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton/), and other clips relating to our research findings. We'll also give you the opportunity to ink your own short autobiographical story, inspired by an Alice Thornton prompt.
