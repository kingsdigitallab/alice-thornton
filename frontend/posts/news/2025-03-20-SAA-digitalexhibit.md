On March 21st 2025, the Alice Thornton's Books team will be demonstrating the Digital Edition at the [Shakespeare Association of America](https://shakespeareassociation.org/annual-meetings/2025-schedule/) meeting in Boston.

Our project has created a searchable digital edition of her four autobiographical volumes, written c.1659-96. The modernised and semi-diplomatic versions can be read separately or side-by-side. Textual markup enables users to trace people, places and events across the edition and different versions of the same event can be compared on screen.

We will be in the Grand-Liberty Foyer, Sheraton 2F, 10am-12pm.
