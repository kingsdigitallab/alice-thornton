Another opportunity to catch a performance of 'The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton' in Thornton's home territory, North Yorkshire! [Debbie Cannon](https://debbiecannon.org/)'s acclaimed one-women show is part of this year's [Helmsley Literary Festival](https://www.helmsleyarts.co.uk/whats-on/helmsley-literary-festival-2025) in September.  

Tickets are already [on sale](https://www.helmsleyarts.co.uk/whats-on/helmsley-literary-festival-the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton-1626-1707) for a performance at Helmsley Arts Centre on Saturday 13 September, 7-8pm.

Born in Dundee, Debbie is an actor and writer, with a DPhil in Medieval Studies. She has performed her solo play in venues as diverse as Durham Cathedral and the Scottish Storytelling Centre. It is based on the manuscripts of Alice Thornton, who was born in Kirklington and died, over eighty years later, within five miles of Helmsley. Expect scandal, faith, family fallouts and insights into the life of the gentry in general, and this singular woman in particular, during dangerous times, including the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the English Civil War.
