In our first event of 2024, Prof. Suzanne Trill (Co-Investigator) will give a talk 'Alice Thornton's Books: A Seventeenth-Century Handmaid's Tale' to the Leith branch of the Scottish Women's Institute. We look forward to meeting members of the group in Edinburgh on January 9th 2024. Suzanne's talk will be followed by a short writing activity using dip ink. 

The evening will be free to members of [Leith SWI](https://leithswi.wixsite.com/leithswi).
