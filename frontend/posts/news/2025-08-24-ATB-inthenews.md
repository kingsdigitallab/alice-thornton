Have you seen that our project has had some news coverage? First, we appeared in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/04/womans-memoirs-fascinating-insight-life-17th-century-northern-england), with project lead Cordelia Beattie talking to Harriet Sherwood. The story has now been picked up by the [Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/read-the-dramatic-17th-century-memoirs-of-alice-thornton-who-wrote-four-versions-of-her-life-story-180987167/) with Sonja Anderson drawing on a variety of online sources for her account.

Our funders, [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/news/ahrc-project-sheds-light-on-the-life-of-17th-century-memoirist/), also featured our project on their website, as did our home institution, the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/memoirs-share-vivid-life-of-17th-century-woman).

We were delighted that some of these accounts mentioned Debbie Cannon's play ['The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton'](https://debbiecannon.org/the-remarkable-deliverances-of-alice-thornton/), which is next on at Helmsley Literary Festival in September. But we wanted to give a particular shout out to the two postdoctoral fellows, [Dr Joanne Edge](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/people/jedge/) and [Dr Sharon Howard](https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/people/showard/), who are not named in all the articles. And to [Dr Eleanor Thom](https://eleanorthom.com) who was our Engagement Officer and got that seventeenth-century Eastenders quote which a few of the stories use! 

Spotted Alice Thornton's Books elsewhere? Do let us know as we had initially missed the Smithsonian Magazine write up.
