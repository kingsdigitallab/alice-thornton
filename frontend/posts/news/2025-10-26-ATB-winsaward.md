We are delighted to share the news that the Alice Thornton’s Books project has been recognised by the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women and Gender (SSEMWG) in their annual publication awards.

Along with Alexandre LeGrand, the team received a ‘Co-Honourable Mention’ in the Digital Scholarship (DS) category. We are proud to see our project esteemed in this way and want to congratulate everyone-else whose name appeared on this year’s list.

We would especially like to congratulate the overall winners of the DS category - [Rosalind Smith](https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/rosalind-smith) and [Patricia Pender](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/patricia-j-pender) - for their incredible achievement in creating [*The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Early Modern Women’s Writing*](https://link-springer-com.eux.idm.oclc.org/referencework/10.1007/978-3-030-01537-4), which 'brings together over 260 international scholars to produce more than 400 entries illuminating women’s authorship between 1500 and 1700. As a dynamic, evolving digital resource, it consolidates over fifty years of scholarship on writers, genres, and material practices while opening pathways for new and emerging critical approaches'.

Cordelia and Suzanne have contributed an entry on Alice Thornton and, with [Lisa Walters](https://communication-arts.uq.edu.au/profile/6354/lisa-walters) and [Natasha Simonova](https://natashasimonova.com), Suzanne is one of the co-editors of the section on Restoration women writers.

Congratulations one and all; for full details, see [SSEMWG: 2025 Awards](https://www.ssemwg.org/2025).
