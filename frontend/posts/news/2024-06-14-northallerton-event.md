On July 5th 2024, the Alice Thornton's Books team will be visiting the [North Yorkshire County Record Office](https://archiveshop.northyorks.gov.uk/), Malpas Road, Northallerton. 

The archives are hosting an afternoon of Thornton-related events, from 2-4pm. The afternoon will begin with a talk by Project PI Cordelia Beattie on 'Yorkshire gentlewoman Alice Thornton (1626-1707)'. After a short break, this will be followed by a play, ‘The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton’, written and performed by [Debbie Cannon](https://debbiecannon.org). Archive materials relevant to Thornton will also be on display.

The event is open to all and costs £2 (paid on the door) which includes light refreshments. 

We are very much looking forward to meeting an audience for whom Alice Thornton is a local!
