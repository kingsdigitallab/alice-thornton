On July 5th 2024, the Alice Thornton's Books team will be visiting the [North Yorkshire County Record Office](https://archiveshop.northyorks.gov.uk/), Malpas Road, Northallerton. The archives are hosting an afternoon of Thornton-related events. The afternoon will run from 2pm till 4pm, beginning with a short talk by Cordelia Beattie. This will be followed by the play, ‘The Remarkable Deliverances of Alice Thornton’, written and performed by [Debbie Cannon](https://debbiecannon.org). Archive materials relevant to Thornton will also be displayed in cases.

We are very much looking forward to meeting an audience for whom Alice Thornton is a local. 

The event is open to all and costs £2 (paid on the door) which includes light refreshments.
