We are hosting Alice Thornton’s Café on 18 November in Edinburgh as part of [Being Human](https://www.beinghumanfestival.org/), the UK’s national festival of the humanities.

This is a completely free event for the whole community to enjoy. Come to Edinburgh's Starbank Park on November 18th and find out about Alice Thornton, a 17th-century Yorkshire woman who survived fire, plague, rebellion and family life, and wrote about it all!

* Free tea, coffee, cake and a talk with Cordelia Beattie (PI) and Jo Edge (PDRA), from the Thornton’s Books team.  
11 am and 1:30 pm [(please reserve here)](https://www.beinghumanfestival.org/events/alice-thorntons-cafe) 
* 17th-century herbal remedy-themed crafts from 11am – 2:30 pm.
* A stroll round the gardens at 11:30 am and 2:00 pm to see the new Alice Thornton-themed planting, with Janet McArthur from [Friends of Starbank Park](https://friendsofstarbankpark.org/). Starbank Park was recently one of the Scotsman's [top locations](https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/outdoors/edinburgh-things-to-do-10-hidden-gems-and-beauty-spots-perfect-for-autumn-walks-4168259?fbclid=IwAR2UzihXEALWyt-6KOguiuYBk9vIwXc0aiIhFax-Fw5Kljg_ttyHcghrut4) for an autumn stroll in the capital.
