Dr Jo Edge specialises in late medieval and early modern European social and cultural history, with an emphasis on medicine and the ‘occult’ sciences: divination, magic and astrology; as well as the experience of illness and death. She cut her digital humanities teeth as Assistant Editor on the Casebooks Project at the University of Cambridge (2014-18). She has also held library and lectureship positions at the University of Manchester. Her first book, ***Numerological Divination in Late Medieval England*** is under contract with Boydell and Brewer. She is especially interested in Thornton’s accounts of her own illnesses and descriptions of the deathbed scenes of her close family members.
