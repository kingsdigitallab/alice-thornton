She moved to Virginia, citing her father’s support for the king. She refers to Lady Berkeley (Frances Culpeper Berkeley), wife to three colonial governors of Virginia, as a ‘cousin’. While in Virginia, c.1652, she married Christopher Danby, Thornton's nephew, against the wishes of his father, Thomas Danby. Her first child, born in Virginia in 1653, died straight after the birth. The couple relocated to Yorkshire and lived with Christopher's older brother, Thomas, at Farnley Hall and had five more children (three sons and two daughters). Anne and her family lived with the Thorntons at East Newton at least twice in the 1660s: firstly c.1661 for three months and then, after the death of her husband’s brother, in 1667, when she was cast out by his widow, Margaret Danby. In 1668, she was evicted by William Thornton for spreading rumours. She died on 11 November 1695 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Micklegate, York.</note>

His mother died in 1645 and his father took the family to Virginia in 1650. Around 1652 he married Anne Culpeper, against his father's wishes. Their first child, born in Virginia, died straight after birth. They moved back to Yorkshire and had five children (three sons and two daughters). On his older brother’s death in 1667, he became heir to his father's estate but granted it to his son, Abstrupus, in the same year, as he was thought incapable of running it. He was sent to the Channel Islands as a soldier sometime in the late 1660s or early 1670s. He was in London for some time in the early 1670s. In 1683 he was involved in legal action with his sister-in-law, Margaret Danby and, in the 1680s, he was in close contact with Thornton in the 1680s. He was buried on 25 November 1689 at St Mary’s, Masham.</note>

He was probably a descendant of George Lascelles of Sturton and Gateford, Nottinghamshire, who married Eleanor Wandesford, a distant cousin of Thornton’s father. Perhaps the Edward Lascelles buried on 22 August 1675 at St Michael-le-Belfrey’s, York.</note>

Between 1640-5 they had six children (four sons and two daughters), although all four of their sons died in infancy. The couple moved to Chester in the early 1640s and, when the first English Civil War broke out in 1642, Mainwaring enrolled as a Sergeant-Major. He was knighted at Oxford on 9 January 1643, having fought for the king at Edge Hill in October 1642. When William Brereton’s parliamentary forces attacked Chester in 1643, leading to a siege, he commanded men in the defence of the city, acting as a member of the council approving the dispatch of troops, and then as a senior commissioner in 1644. Mainwaring was shot and killed, around 9 October 1645, trying to defend the city during a successful attack by Brereton’s forces. His memorial in Chester Cathedral, erected in 1671, erroneously gives his year of death as 1644.</note>

                  <note type="bio">Robert Nettleton, the eldest son of Thomas and Mary Nettleton of Thornhill, Yorks., was born in 1601. He was educated at Gray’s Inn (1619) and gained his Oxford BA in 1621 and MA in 1623. He married Frances Rawlinson and they had nine children (six daughters and three sons). He arrived in Ireland with his younger brother, George, c.1633 and was elected MP for Lifford in 1639, returning to Yorkshire in the early 1640s. In 1652 he inherited a debt from his sister whose late husband had lent Christopher Wandesford £500 pre-1640. William Thornton became a target when he took over the role of administering Wandesford's will c.1661. Nettleton died in 1673 after falling from a horse and was buried on 3 July at St Michael and All Angels’, Thornhill.</note>

While he has been described as the most popular Puritan preacher of the Elizabethan era, Smith had little time for separatist ideas and his avoidance of controversial theological issues made his sermons very popular. Over twenty editions of his collected sermons were published between 1592 and 1675.</note>

He gained the Danby estate around 1683, from his father, the second son of Thomas Danby, who had inherited it on his elder brother’s murder in 1667. The estate was in debt and so he sold off much of the family's property (at Scruton, Thorpe Perrow, Driffield and Thornton Watlass) but came to be known as the 'Restorer' of his family. He corresponded with Thornton during the 1680s and 1690s, largely over money she felt owed. He was knighted in 1691 and was MP for Aldborough 1698-1700.

He married Elizabeth Maskewe in 1611 and they went on to have 13 children, although only one survived childhood. He married his second wife, Susanna, c.1641 and they had two sons with one surviving to adulthood. Hoyle took up the Freedom of the city of York in 1612 and was warden of St Martin's, Micklegate in 1613. Rising up the civic ranks over the next 20 years, he became an alderman in 1626 and Mayor of York in 1632. A devout presbyterian, he called for Charles I to be brought to justice but took no part in the king's trial. He hanged himself on 30 January 1650, exactly a year after the regicide, in his lodgings at Broad Sanctuary, Westminster.</note>

He was possibly the Nathaniel Jackson who briefly held the rectorship of St Cuthbert’s, Halsall, Lancashire, after the expulsion of royalist Peter Travers in 1645. A puritan, he was rector of All Saints’, Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire, 1647-60, but was deprived on the restoration. Before 1648 he married Anne (birth surname unknown) and they had a son and a daughter. It seems he may have again held the rectorship of Holy Trinity, Stonegrave between 1660-2 before he died.

His family property was sequestered after the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and Osborne was exiled to Europe in the early 1650s. He married Bridget Bertie and they had 11 children (three sons and eight daughters). He became High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1661 and Lord Treasurer 1673-79. In June 1674 he was made Earl of Danby. Impeached after the 'Popish Plot' in 1678, he spent the next six years in the Tower of London. He was then released on bail and played a key role in the plot against James II, advising William of Orange, who, on becoming king in 1688, made him President of the Privy Council. He was made Marquess of Carmarthen in April 1689. His cousin, Thornton, wrote to him at least three times asking for his help:  when he was Lord Treasurer in 1673 about a dispute between Osborne and her brother Christopher; in July 1689, thanking him with helping her son Robert to gain preferment; and in September 1689, seeking preferment for her son-in-law, Thomas Comber. He was made Duke of Leeds in May 1694, but the next year was involved in a corruption scandal and left the political arena.

                  <note type="bio">Francis Thorpe, oldest son of Roger and Elizabeth Thorpe of Birdsall, Yorks, was born in 1594. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1611 and graduated from St John's College, Cambridge in 1614. He was called to the bar in 1621 and was elected Recorder of Beverley in 1624. He married the twice-widowed Elizabeth Denton (née Oglethorpe). In 1645 he was elected 'recruiter' MP (filling a vacancy caused by a by-election) for Richmond. During the second English Civil War he played an important role organising parliamentary forces in the north and was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1648. While named commissioner to try the king in January 1649 he took no part in it. In February 1649 he was appointed to ride the northern circuit, which included Yorkshire. He was judge on this circuit for the winter assizes from 1649 (when still a serjeant) to 1653 and the summer assizes 1649-51 and again in 1659. On 1 June 1659 he was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Beverley in 1654 but was prevented from sitting due to his refusing to try fellow Yorkshiremen after Penruddock's rising. He took up his seat in 1659 but his legal career was ended by the restoration of Charles II in 1660. He died intestate and was buried at All Hallows’, Bardsey on 7 June 1665.</note>
