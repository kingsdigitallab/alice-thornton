            ID construction is based on name initials:
            uses full initials where known
            for married women include maiden surname initial if known
            if firstname [or surname for that matter] unavailable use x
            then add number to ensure uniqueness
            
            any "tbd" IDs are waiting to be verified

He was baptised on 26 August 1605 at St. Michael the Archangel, Kirklington. He married Rebecca Reade and they had a daughter, Catherine. His brother, Christopher, sent him to be an apprentice to a London merchant. He was granted an annuity of £20 for life on 30 June 1637 out of Wandesford property at Castlecomer, Ireland, paid yearly at Christ's Church, Dublin. He suffered severe losses during the wars of the three kingdoms due to his loyalty to the royal cause. On 31 July 1646 he declared he had been at Oxford when Castlecomer was held for the king and that he lent money but had not taken up arms. According to Thornton, a committee who advised Charles I during his trial met in his London home. He was made a gentleman-pensioner by Charles II after the Restoration in 1660 and died in 1690.</note>

She married Thomas Purchas, rector, by arrangement of her brother-in-law, Thomas Comber, on 27 December 1682. She had five children by Purchas, three sons and two daughters. After Purchas's death in April 1697, she married Robert Danby of Northallerton in 1698, without her mother’s approval. She died on 17 December 1726 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Stonegrave.</note>

She was then in the service of Alice Wandesford, and before 1654, she married another servant of Wandesford’s, George Lightfoot. The couple had at least one child, a daughter named Mary.  Daphne prayed with Wandesford at her bedside in 1659, and she and her husband were witnesses to her will, in which they were left 20s each. After Lady  Wandesford’s death, there are references to Daphne at East Newton Hall, helping out with duties such as wet-nursing Thornton’s daughter Elizabeth (Betty) in 1655, producing an inventory of goods after William Thornton’s death, and providing other support to Thornton during the tumultuous year of 1668. She was present with her daughter Mary at the private wedding of Thomas and Alice Comber on 17 November 1668. Daphne and her husband might still have been working at East Newton Hall in 1682 when he is mentioned in a letter from Thomas Comber to his mother-in-law. She was buried on 20 September 1689 at St. Agatha’s, Gilling West.</note>

A Puritan who owned extensive estates in Cheshire, and Member of Parliament for Cheshire at various times between 1628 and 1653, he was commander of Parliamentarian forces throughout the North Midlands during the First Civil War of 1642-47. He married twice; first, Susanna Booth in 1623, by whom he had four children, three daughters and a son; and, after her death, Cicely Mytton in 1641, a wealthy Staffordshire widow, by whom he had two more daughters. When the First Civil War ended, Brereton gave up his local offices and, although nominated as a judge, refused to attend the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He was elected to the Council of State in 1652 and 1653 but did not attend frequently, living in semi-retirement in London. He resumed his seat for Cheshire when the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659, until its dissolution in March 1660, and died on 7 April 1661.</note>

Thornton describes him as her ‘cousin Browne’ in one account, so it is possible that he was her kinsman, perhaps by marriage. He was educated at St John's Cambridge (BA 1639). He was instituted at St. Mary's, Masham in 1639 and made vicar there in 1645. His role was sequestered in the 1650s, and he was restored there after the Restoration in 1661. He was probably married since he and a Mrs Browne both attended Thornton in August 1662 at East Newton when she took communion. He was ordained priest at York in September 1662. He was buried on 11 December 1681.</note>

                  <note type="bio">Anne Danby (1630-1695) was the daughter of Mr John Culpeper. While we have not been able to confidently identify her father, in her Accompt written in 1683 Anne says that he was a royalist in England who had to flee to Virginia due to his support for the King, meaning Anne was born in England. However he cannot be Sir John Culpeper, identified by some as her father, because he died in 1660, and Anne says her father died before she was married in 1652. Anne also mentions being related to Lady Berkeley (Frances Culpeper Berkeley), wife to three colonial governors of Virginia. While in Virginia, c.1652, Anne married Christopher Danby, son of Katherine and Thomas Danby, becoming Alice Thornton's niece. Christopher's father did not approve of the match. Her first child born in Virginia in 1653 died straight after the birth. The couple relocated to Yorkshire and lived with Christopher's older brother and heir Thomas Danby at Farnley Hall, and had five more children, three sons and two daughters. It seems that Danby and her family lived with the Thorntons at East Newton at least twice in the 1660s: firstly in 1661 or 1662 for three months and later, after the death of Thomas Danby in 1667 and in the midst of continuing conflict between Anne and Thomas's widow, Margaret. In 1668, she was allegedly the source of rumours about Thomas Comber and Alice Thornton, resulting in her being evicted from the household by William Thornton. She died on 11 November 1695 and was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Micklegate, York.</note>

He married Christopher Wandesford’s daughter, Katherine, in 1630, making him Alice Thornton's brother-in-law. He was knighted in 1633, became Sheriff of York in 1637 and was elected MP for Richmond in 1640. He was banned from sitting in Parliament after 1642 and was fined heavily for his loyalty to Charles I. He and Katherine had 10 live-born children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. After his wife's death in 1645, he relocated to Virginia where he held lands, moving back to Yorkshire in the 1650s. He died in London on 5 August 1660 and was buried in the north aisle of the choir at York Minster.</note>

She married Ranald Graham of Lewisham c.1640. The couple purchased Nunnington Hall in Ryedale in 1655 and Ranald became Justice of the Peace of the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1662. This brought Susanna into the social circle of Alice Thornton, who counted her as a friend. She was godmother to Thornton's youngest daughter and eighth child Joyce, born in 1665. She died on 26 February 1699 and was buried in the parish church at Lewisham.</note>

                  <note type="bio">George Lightfoot was a servant in the household of Alice Wandesford in the 1650s. He married another of the household servants, Daphne Cassell, before 1654, and they had at least one child, a daughter. A literate man, he and Daphne were witnesses to Alice Wandesford's will in 1659. It seems likely that after her death, the Lightfoots entered the Thorntons’ service as there are indications of them working at East Newton after 1668, and then going into the service of the Combers. George and his wife might still have been working at East Newton Hall in 1682 when he is mentioned in a letter from Thomas Comber to his mother-in-law. We do not know when he died.</note>

A servant of Alice Wandesford, he was present at the wedding of Alice and William Thornton in 1651 and is mentioned in Alice Wandesford’s will of 1659 (but could not sign his name), in which he was named as her servant. He had four daughters and a son. He may have been the local man to whom the Thorpe Edge lead mine in Swaledale was leased in 1656 along with Robert Barker and some Derbyshire investors. His will, dated 29 August 1672, shows that he owed money to Christopher Wandesford, Alice Thornton's brother. He was buried at St Michael and All Angels, Hudswell, North Yorkshire.</note>

He was briefly engaged to the only daughter of John Finch but she died age 10 in 1621. He married Anne Trappes at Thornhill, York on 21 February 1622. This made him a cousin-by-marriage of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl Strafford, and George became part of Strafford's Irish administration 1633-40. He was imprisoned in Dublin Castle after being tried for treason in 1640. After his release in 1642 he spent much of his time in the Netherlands and died in 1657. George and Anne had a son.</note>

In the late 1640s or very early 1650s he plotted to abduct Alice Thornton, but a man named Thomas Binks warned her of the plot and she was able to escape. He married Mary Wingate, and they had a son and a daughter. A deposition against Smithson for libel taken at York Castle in 1665 provides clear evidence that he changed his name from Jeremy to Jerome. He became 2nd Baronet Stanwick on his father's death in 1670 and died in 1684.</note>

He was born on 19 September 1662 at East Newton and baptised the next day at Holy Trinity, Stonegrave. He was educated first by John Denton, then by the reverend John Burton at Sutton-on-the-Forest. He entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in April 1680, before moving to University College, Oxford in May 1682. In 1687 he became the rector of Oddington but resigned it later that year. He was by now heavily in debt. In 1691 he was offered a living in Northamptonshire but swapped it for that of Boldon, diocese of Durham, and resided at the Deanery in Durham with his sister, Alice, and her husband, Thomas Comber. In 1692 Comber helped arrange a marriage for him, to a woman worth £2800, but he fell ill and died on 4 June 1692, aged 29. He is buried in the Chapel of the Nine Altars, Durham Cathedral.</note>

                  <note type="bio">Sir Thomas Osborne (1632-1712), 1st Duke of Leeds (formerly Earl of Danby and Marquess of Carmarthen), was the second son of Sir Edward Osborne of Kiveton and his second wife, Anne. He became his father's heir in 1638 when his older brother was killed in an accident. His family property was sequestered after the battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and Osborne was exiled to Europe in the early 1650s. He married Bridget Bertie, and they had 11 children, three sons and eight daughters. He became High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1661 and Lord Treasurer 1673-79. Impeached after the 'Popish Plot' in 1678, he spent the next six years in the Tower of London. He was then released on bail and played a key role in the plot against James II, advising William of Orange, who, on becoming king, made him President of the Privy Council. His cousin, Alice Thornton, wrote to him at least three times asking for his help:  when he was Lord Treasurer in 1673 for assistance with arbitrating a dispute between herself and her brother, Christopher; in July 1689, seeking preferment for her son Robert; and in September 1689, seeking preferment for her son-in-law, Thomas Comber. He was dismissed in the mid-1690s and died on 26 July 1712 at his daughter Sophia’s house, Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. He was buried at Harthill, Yorkshire.</note>

He frequently returned to Ireland in the 1640s and was appointed commander of the army of Leinster in 1642. He was made Viscount Tara and Governor of Waterford in 1650.

                  <note type="bio">Gilbert Sheldon (1598-1677) was the youngest son of Roger Sheldon, born 19 June 1598. His father was bailiff to Gilbert Talbot, the earl of Shrewsbury. He graduated from Trinity College, Oxford, in 1617, and got his MA from Cambridge in 1620. After entering All Souls as a fellow, he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Oxford at Dorchester and probably ordained priest shortly afterwards. A royalist during the war, he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663, a position he held until his death on 9 November 1677.</note>

She is perhaps Grace (née Bond) of Breighton who married Elias Sherwood at Bubwith, East Yorkshire, on 2 November 1665.</note>

He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1611 and graduated from St John's College Cambridge in 1614. He was called to the bar in 1621. He was elected Recorder of Beverley in 1624. He married the twice-widowed Elizabeth Denton (née Oglethorpe). He was in London for much of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1645 he was elected 'recruiter' MP (i.e. filling a vacancy caused by a by-election) for Richmond. During the second English Civil War he played an important role organising Parliamentary forces in the North and was appointed serjeant-at-law in 1648. While named commissioner to try the king in January 1649 he took no part in it. Later in 1649 he was appointed to ride the northern circuit. On 1 June that year he was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Beverley in 1654 but was prevented from sitting due to refusing to try fellow Yorkshiremen after Penruddock's rising. He took up his seat in 1659 and was reinstated as Baron of the Exchequer in 1660. He was buried at Bardsey Church on 7 June 1665.</note>
