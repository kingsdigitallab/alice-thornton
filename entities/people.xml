            if firstname [or surname for that matter] unavailable use x

      <label type="minister">Dr Peter Samways</label>
      <desc>Peter Samways was born at Eltham, Kent, in 1615, the son of a âperson about the court.â He was educated at Westminster School and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he then became one of the college tutors until 1650. During his residence at Cambridge he contributed verses to the university collections royalist poems. In or before 1657 he became rector of Malden, Bedfordshire, and in 1659 he was chaplain to Elizabeth, countess of Peterborough. He was presented by Lord Salisbury to the vicarage of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, from which he was expelled by the parliamentary visitors because he persisted in reading the liturgy of the church of England, when he was also deprived of his fellowship at Trinity. After the Restoration he was created D.D. at Cambridge, by royal mandate, on 5 Sept. 1660, but he was not reinstated in his benefice at Cheshunt, probably because, on 31 Dec. 1660, he was presented to the rectory of Wath, near Ripon, Yorkshire, worth about 140l. per annum, by the Earl of Aylesbury, in whose family he had spent some time during the rebellion. Soon afterwards he was presented by Charles II to the neighbouring rectory of Bedale, worth nearly 600l. a year. It was during the late 1650s and 1660s that Samways appears in Alice's books, attending the final illness of her mother Alice Osborn in December 1659. According to Alice, he was one of the people taken in by the rumours begun by Anne Danby about her daughter Nally's marriage to Thomas Comber in 1668. He was a great benefactor to the parish of Wath, where he built and endowed a school. On 27 May 1668 he was collated to the prebend of Barneby inÂ the church of York. He was a staunch supporter of the church of England, and it is recorded of him that he boldly disputed the doctrine of transubstantiation with the Duke of York (afterwards James II). He fell under the displeasure of Bishop Cartwright, then administering the see of York, by refusing to subscribe the king's declaration for liberty of conscience in 1688, and he narrowly escaped a second ejection from his benefices. Samways further aided the cause of civil and religious liberty by publishing a letter, which had a considerable effect in persuading the clergy of his neighbourhood to take the oaths to King William and Queen Mary, and for this service he is said to have received an offer of the bishopric of Bath and Wells which he declined. Among his intimate friends were Dr. Isaac Barrow and Archbishops Ussher and Sancroft. He died at Bedale in April 1693. CRIBBED AND ADAPTED FROM ODNB SO NEEDS MORE CHANGING.</desc>

      <desc>Alice Thornton Comber, called Nally, was born in 1653 or 1654 to Alice Wandesford and William Thornton. She was their second child but first born alive, and one of three of the Thornton children to survive to adulthood. She married Thomas Comber in 1668, by whom she had 6 children, four sons and two daughters. Nally's marriage to Comber was at the centre of the slanders against the Thornton family spearheaded by Nally's cousin Anne Danby. Nally was very young â about 14 or 15 â when she married Comber. Other rumours possibly centred on Nally's mother Alice's relationship with Comber, who had been living with the family at East Newton since 1665 when he took up the curacy of Stonegrave. She died on 20 January 1720/21.</desc>

      <label type="uncle">William Wandesford</label>
      <desc>William Wandesford was baptised in 26 August 1605 at Kirklington, the youngest son of Sir George Wandesford by his second wife, Mary Pamplyn. He was Alice Thornton's half-uncle. He married Rebecca Reade (b. 1616), daughter of William Reade of Kent, on 16 July 1632, and had a daughter named Catherine, who married William Smith. His brother Christopher sent him to be an apprentice to a London merchant. He was granted an annuity of Â£20 for life on 30 June 1637 out of his property at Castlecomer, Ireland and paid yearly at Christ's Church, Dublin. He suffered severe losses during the civil war due to his loyalty to the royal cause, and on 31 July 1646 he declared he had been at Oxford when Castlecomer was held for the king, and that he lent money but had not taken up arms. He was made a gentleman-pensioner by Charles II after the Restoration in 1660, and died in 1690 aged 85.</desc>
