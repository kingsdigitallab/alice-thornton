            <label>Alice Wandesford Thornton</label>
            <desc>Alice Wandesford (1626-1707) was born to Christopher Wandesford – later Lord Deputy of Ireland – and his wife Alice Osborne in Kirklington, North Yorkshire on 13 February 1626. She was their fifth child of seven, and their youngest daughter. The family relocated to Dublin in the 1630s when Wandesford's friend and mentor Thomas Wentworth, 1st Lord Strafford, became Lord Deputy of Ireland. Wandesford succeeded Wentworth in 1640 but died that same year, and the family located back to Yorkshire during the Civil War. She married William Thornton of East Newton in 1651, and they had nine children, three of whom survived to adulthood: Alice (Nally), Katherine and Robert. William Thornton died in 1668. Alice wrote three autobiographies, ('Books of my Life') and a Book of Remembrances. She died in 1707 at East Newton and is buried at Stonegrave.</desc>

He attended Trinity College, Dublin from 1636.

He drowned in the River Swale, Yorkshire, through which he was riding on horseback, on 31 March 1651, on the way to visit his cousin William Wandesford.</desc>

He was Alice Thornton's half-uncle. He married Rebecca Reade. His brother Christopher sent him to be an apprentice to a London merchant. He was granted an annuity of £20 for life on 30 June 1637 out of his property at Castlecomer, Ireland and paid yearly at Christ's Church, Dublin. He suffered severe losses during the civil war due to his loyalty to the royal cause, and on 31 July 1646 he declared he had been at Oxford when Castlecomer was held for the king, and that he lent money but had not taken up arms. He was made a gentleman-pensioner by Charles II after the Restoration in 1660 and died in 1690 aged 85.</desc>

She was their second child but first born alive, and one of three of the Thornton children to survive to adulthood. She married Thomas Comber in 1668, by whom she had six children, four sons and two daughters. Nally's marriage to Comber was at the centre of the slanders against the Thornton family spearheaded by Nally's cousin-by-marriage Anne Danby. Nally was very young – 14 – when she married Comber. Other rumours possibly centred on Nally's mother relationship with Comber, who had been living with the family at East Newton since 1665 when he took up the curacy of Stonegrave. She died on 20 January 1721.</desc>

            <label>Dr Peter Samways</label>
            <desc>Peter Samways was born at Eltham, Kent, in 1615, the son of a ‘person about the court.’ He was educated at Westminster School and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he then became one of the college tutors until 1650. During his residence at Cambridge he contributed verses to the university collections royalist poems. In or before 1657 he became rector of Malden, Bedfordshire, and in 1659 he was chaplain to Elizabeth, countess of Peterborough. He was presented by Lord Salisbury to the vicarage of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, from which he was expelled by the parliamentary visitors because he persisted in reading the liturgy of the church of England, when he was also deprived of his fellowship at Trinity. After the Restoration he was created D.D. at Cambridge, by royal mandate, on 5 Sept. 1660, but he was not reinstated in his benefice at Cheshunt, probably because, on 31 Dec. 1660, he was presented to the rectory of Wath, near Ripon, Yorkshire, worth about 140l. per annum, by the Earl of Aylesbury, in whose family he had spent some time during the rebellion. Soon afterwards he was presented by Charles II to the neighbouring rectory of Bedale, worth nearly 600l. a year. It was during the late 1650s and 1660s that Samways appears in Alice's books, attending the final illness of her mother Alice Osborne in December 1659. According to Alice, he was one of the people taken in by the rumours begun by Anne Danby about her daughter Nally's marriage to Thomas Comber in 1668. He was a great benefactor to the parish of Wath, where he built and endowed a school. On 27 May 1668 he was collated to the prebend of Barneby in the church of York. He was a staunch supporter of the church of England, and it is recorded of him that he boldly disputed the doctrine of transubstantiation with the Duke of York (afterwards James II). He fell under the displeasure of Bishop Cartwright, then administering the see of York, by refusing to subscribe the king's declaration for liberty of conscience in 1688, and he narrowly escaped a second ejection from his benefices. Samways further aided the cause of civil and religious liberty by publishing a letter, which had a considerable effect in persuading the clergy of his neighbourhood to take the oaths to King William and Queen Mary, and for this service he is said to have received an offer of the bishopric of Bath and Wells which he declined. Among his intimate friends were Dr. Isaac Barrow and Archbishops Ussher and Sancroft. He died at Bedale in April 1693. CRIBBED AND ADAPTED FROM ODNB SO NEEDS MORE CHANGING.

She was with Alice's sister Katherine when she died after childbirth in 1645 and prayed with Alice's mother at her death bed in 1659. She and her husband were witnesses to Alice's mothers will. Daphne was a close friend and confidante of Alice's throughout the events Alice discusses in her books. She breastfed Alice's child Elizabeth for three months when Alice was unable to produce milk. She helped Alice with the inventory of her house when her husband died leaving debts in 1668, and was also a staunch defender of Alice's during the Danby scandal which was happening at the same time.</desc>

            <label>Sir William Brereton</label>
            <desc>Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet, (1604–1661), was an English Puritan who owned extensive estates in Cheshire, and Member of Parliament for Cheshire county at various times between 1628 and 1653. During the First English Civil War, he was commander of Parliamentarian forces in the North Midlands. He married twice; firstly, Susanna Booth, by whom he had four children, 3 daughters and a son; and after her death Cicely Mytton, a wealthy Staffordshire widow, by whom he had two more daughters. When Christopher Wandesford's family, including a teenage Alice, fled Ireland after his death in 1640 and landed in Cheshire, they were held up on their way home to Yorkshire at Chester due to Brereton's Parliamentary forces. When the Civil War ended in 1646, Brereton gave up his local offices, and although nominated as a judge, refused to attend the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He was elected to the Council of State in 1652 and 1653 but rarely attended, living in semi-retirement in London. He resumed his seat for Cheshire when the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659, until its dissolution in March 1660, and died on 7 April 1661.</desc>

He was brought to Ireland by Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford as head of government in Ireland in 1633 and was present at the meal where Christopher Wandesford, Alice Thornton's father became unwell in 1640, dying soon afterwards. He witnessed Wandesford's will. He commanded the Royalist forces in Ireland during the Civil War of the 1640s and subsequent Cromwellian invasion, and Alice mentions his becoming Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. He died at his estate at Kingston Lacey, Dorset, on 21 July 1688.</desc>

Circa 1652 she married Christopher Danby, son of Katherine Wandesford and Thomas Danby and Alice Thornton's nephew, making here Alice's niece-in-law. The Culpeper and Danby families were early settlers in colonial Maryland, and, according to Alice Thornton, Christopher's father did not approve of the match. By the time their first son Abstrupus was born in 1655 they had moved back to Yorkshire, and a daughter, Francilia, followed in 1659. By the late 1660s Anne Danby was living with Alice Thornton and her family at East Newton, and in 1668, according to Alice, was responsible for the slanders that had been spread regarding the marriage of Alice's daughter Nally to Thomas Comber, resulting in her being kicked out of the house by William Thornton. She died on 11 November 1695 at York.</desc>

            <desc>Susanna Washington Grahame (born 15 January 1618) was the daughter of William Washington and Anne Villiers. She married Ranald (Reginald) Graham of Lewisham c. 1640. He became Justice of the Peace of the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1662, and this would have brought her into the social circle of Alice Thornton, who counted her as a friend. She was godmother to Alice's youngest daughter and eighth child Joyce, born in 1665. She also gave Alice advice on medicine, and sent a carriage to take away Anne Danby from the Thornton house at East Newton to York after the scandal of 1668. She died on 26 February 1699 and was buried in the parish church at Lewisham.</desc>
