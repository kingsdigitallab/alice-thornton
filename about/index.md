## About Our Research Project

This AHRC-funded research project will create an online digital edition of all four of Alice Wandesford Thornton’s autobiographical manuscripts. For the first time, the full text of each volume will be freely available to a wide range of users.

Now that all the original manuscripts have been located, we are finally able to ‘unedit’ Jackson’s nineteenth-century edition. Whereas that version bowdlerised Thornton’s manuscripts to produce a single, chronological narrative, this edition will enable users to explore how she revised her story.


Instead of amalgamating different versions of the same story or event, this edition will enable users to locate variants through both key-word searches and event tagging. [More on tagging.]

In the light of this new material, we aim to answer three key questions:
1. How do Thornton’s texts complicate current scholarship on early modern life-writing, particularly its gendered nature?
2. Why did Thornton write four different autobiographical texts? How do they relate to each other and what might this reveal about their timing, process of composition and audience?
3. How does Thornton’s engagement with contemporary legal, medical, political, and religious discourses enhance understanding of early modern women in Britain and Ireland?
