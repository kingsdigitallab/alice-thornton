# Github starter page

Some of the research data and project web site content is hosted in a [Github](github.com) file repository managed by KDL (we'll send you the link). The repository is a dedicated cloud space for your file which can be collaboratively edited by KDL and the research team. All changes are versioned, all files are public.

Github is the cloud repository provider. And Git is the versioning system it is based on.

## How do I access the repository?

If you only need to browse the files, you can do so without an account, directly on the github.com website.

First you need to [create github account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't one yet. Then let KDL know what your account name/id is so we can give you access to the repository.

## How can I interact with the files on github?

Here are four options, from the most simple to the most advanced. If you are new to github, try option 1 first and move to option 2 it is too limiting. If you have experience with coding environments, option 4 might be preferred.

### 1. Github.com website

The github.com site lets you search, browse and edit html, markdown or json files and save your changes immediatelly. You don't need to download anything and the changes occur directly on the cloud. 

### 2. Desktop Git clients

In this option and the following ones you copy the cloud repository locally (i.e. on your machine), modify the files with the editors of your choice, 
and share the modified files back to the cloud.

The editorial workflow works like this: 
1. clone: a one-off initial download of a github repository to your machine    
2. pull: any subsequent download (to receive changes made by others)
3. edit: the files using your favourite desktop editors
4. commit: to save change files to your local copy of the repository
5. push: to upload your local repository back to the cloud 
6. iterate from step 2

Step 1, 2, 4 and 5 can be done with one of those free desktop Git applications:

### 3. Command line / Terminal

If you are confident with the terminal, the [git application](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) is an efficient command line tool to do steps 1, 2, 4 and 5.

### 4. Integrated development environemnt (IDE)

An IDE is a desktop application dedicated to code development. It integrates git operations and file editing under the same environment. It is very convenient but require some initial set up and is typically filled with distracting features you'll never use.

Recommended free IDEs:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
