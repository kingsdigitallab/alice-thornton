## Background

When Alice Wandesford Thornton died in 1707, she bequeathed 'Three Books of my own Meditations and Transactions of my life, and all the residue of my Papers and Books written with my own hand to her daughter, Alice Thornton Comber. Thornton's nineteenth-century editor, Charles C. Jackson, had access to these original materials via the Comber family. However, after this, the whereabouts of the manuscripts was unclear for many years. In 1982 and 1994, two volumes re-emerged and were sold to a private buyer, Paula Peyraud. These volumes were resold in 2009 and are now held at the British Library. In 2018/19, Cordelia Beattie located the other two manuscripts: one was still in the hands of the Comber family and the other had been in the possession of Durham Cathedral Library (DCL) since 1968 but had been misidentified in the catalogue. Today, both volumes form part of the Comber Collection at DCL. Material evidence suggests that the relationship between these books is not straightforwardly sequential. Indeed, a key question this project seeks to address is why and how these volumes are interconnected?
